A **zero-emissions vehicle**, or **ZEV** will produce no
[emissions](emissions "wikilink") or [pollution](pollution "wikilink")
from the vehicle when stationary or operating. Emissions of concern
include [particulates](particulate "wikilink")
([soot](soot "wikilink")), [hydrocarbons](hydrocarbon "wikilink"),
[carbon monoxide](carbon_monoxide "wikilink") and various [oxides of
nitrogen](/wiki/NOx "wikilink").

Although not considered an emission by the [CARB](/wiki/CARB "wikilink")
definition, [carbon dioxide](carbon_dioxide "wikilink") is one of the
most important [greenhouse gas](greenhouse_gas "wikilink") implicated in
[global warming](global_warming "wikilink") scenarios.

A [bicycle](bicycle "wikilink") is a zero-emissions vehicle (including
all other human-powered vehicles).

The only other generally available technology considered zero emission
is that used in [battery](/wiki/Battery_(electricity) "wikilink") [electric
vehicles](electric_vehicle "wikilink"). Such vehicles do not emit any of
the above pollutants, nor any CO<sub>2</sub> gasses.

Developmental technologies offering zero pollution include:

-   [Hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen "wikilink") utilizing [fuel
    cell](fuel_cell "wikilink") powered electric vehicles ([Hydrogen
    vehicles](/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle "wikilink")).
-   [Compressed air vehicles](/wiki/Compressed_air_vehicle "wikilink"),
    typically recharged by slow (home) or fast (road station) electric
    compressors.
-   [Flywheel energy storage](/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage "wikilink")
    vehicles.
-   [Solar powered cars](/wiki/Solar_car "wikilink") and
    [tribrids](tribrid "wikilink").

What ZEV does not include
-------------------------

Note that "[zero emissions](zero_emissions "wikilink")" does not mean
that the complete power cycle is non-polluting, except in special cases,
since in most cases the energy is provided from [fossil
fuel](fossil_fuel "wikilink") plants. This may still be an advantage for
urban areas when compared to conventional vechicles. Special cases
producing zero pollution in the *operating energy cycle* would include
[electric vehicles](electric_vehicle "wikilink") where an offsetting
amount of zero emissions power is provided, especially solar electric or
wind generated power.

Hydrogen powered vehicles as proposed by the automotive industry are
especially questionable in their net pollution since current economic
production of hydrogen is typically by the processing of [natural
gas](natural_gas "wikilink") or [coal](coal "wikilink") using water in
processes using high temperature and pressure. Unless special care is
taken to [sequester the carbon dioxide](carbon_sequestration "wikilink")
and other more toxic waste from these processes, a future "[hydrogen
economy](hydrogen_economy "wikilink")" may produce even more greenhouse
gases and toxic pollution than the current [fossil
fuel](fossil_fuel "wikilink") usage. However, hydrogen may be produced
from water using electricity, which may be derived from [solar
power](solar_power "wikilink") or [hydropower](hydropower "wikilink"),
but currently at greater expense than from fossil fuels.

"Zero emissions" also does not include emissions associated with
manufacturing such vehicles or components, nor outgassing from synthetic
materials used in vehicle construction, nor soot-like dust from tire
wear, nor potential pollution associated with end-of-life vehicle or
vehicle component dismantling, recycling and reuse.

Notes
-----

The expenses from using solar power appear greater than for fossil fuels
largely because many of the costs of fossil fuels have been
*externalized*, that is to say that someone other than the producer and
consumer of the product bear the indirect costs of the cycle (though
these may be the same population, bearing for example, increased health
costs).'' Further externalised cost pertain to using fast vehicles with
a large overhead in terms of space, energy and weight, for personal
transport in cities. This general issue brings up the discussion of the
[future of the car](future_of_the_car "wikilink") as a primary provider
of transport on planet earth.
