[gumstix.com](http://www.gumstix.com) makes some very fast, small, and
cheap embedded Linux machines. It is possible to connect LCDs and
touchscreens to them, however for automotive use, an
extended-temperature LCD is necessary.

[ezLCD](http://store.earthlcd.com/s.nl/sc.7/category.297/it.A/id.4233/.f)
is a 2.7" color USB LCD with a touchscreen for $200. Probably not
glareproof, probably not extended-temperature, and you still need a
computer that provides host-side USB (unlike the gumstix) but it sure is
cheap.
