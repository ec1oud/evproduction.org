A **sodium-sulfur battery** is a type of
[battery](battery_(electricity) "wikilink") constructed from
[sodium](sodium "wikilink") (Na) and [sulfur](sulfur "wikilink") (S).
This type of battery exhibits a high [energy
density](energy_density "wikilink"), high efficiency of charge/discharge
(89—92%), long cycle life, and is made from inexpensive, non-toxic
materials. However, the operating temperature of 300 to 350 °C and the
highly [corrosive](corrosion "wikilink") nature of sodium make it
suitable only for large-scale non-mobile applications. A suggested
application is [grid energy storage](grid_energy_storage "wikilink"). A
6MWH system has been installed at Tsunashima, Japan.

Construction
------------

The [cell](electrochemical_cell "wikilink") is usually made in a tall
cylindrical configuration. The entire cell is enclosed by an
[inert](inert "wikilink") metal container and sealed at the top with an
airtight [alumina](alumina "wikilink") lid. The cell becomes more
economical with increasing size. In commercial applications the cells
are arranged in blocks for better conservation of heat.

Operation
---------

During the discharge phase, molten [metallic](metal "wikilink") sodium
at the core acts as the [anode](anode "wikilink"), separated by a
[beta-alumina solid
electrolyte](beta-alumina_solid_electrolyte "wikilink") (BASE) cylinder
from a sulfur container made from an inert metal acting as the
[cathode](cathode "wikilink"). The sulfur is absorbed in a
[carbon](carbon "wikilink") sponge. Alumina is a good conductor of
sodium [ions](ion "wikilink") but a bad conductor of electrons, avoiding
self-discharge. When sodium gives off an
[electron](electron "wikilink"), the Na<sup>+</sup> ion migrates to the
sulfur container. The electron travels through the molten sodium to the
contact and through the electric load to the sulfur container. Here, the
electron reacts with sulfur to form S<sup>−</sup>, which then forms
sodium polysulfide. As the cell discharges the sodium level drops.
During the charging phase the reverse process takes place. Once running,
the heat produced by charging and discharging cycles is enough to
maintain operating temperatures and no external source is required.

Safety aspects
--------------

Pure sodium presents dangers because it spontaneously burns on contact
with water. Therefore, the system must be protected from moisture. In
modern NaS cells, sealing techniques make [fires](fire "wikilink")
unlikely.
