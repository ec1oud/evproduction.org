The quickest way to find information here is to look it up directly. On
the left-hand side of your screen there is a **Search** box with two
buttons under it labeled "Go" and "Search". Just type something into the
box, like Bicycle, and press enter or click the **Go** button. This will
take you directly to Wikipedia's article on
[Bicycle](/wiki/Bicycle "wikilink"). There you will most likely find answers
to every question you ever had about bikes, and quite a few you didn't.
If you have any problems, the rest of this article suggests ways to
solve them.

Dictionary definitions and sister projects
------------------------------------------

If you're looking for a dictionary definition, our sister project
[Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a good choice.
For definitions of terms used in Wikipedia, see
[Wikipedia:Glossary](/wiki/Wikipedia:Glossary "wikilink") and
[Wikipedia:Tutorial/Glossary](/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial/Glossary "wikilink").

Other search engines
--------------------

If no such article exists, or if you accidentally press the **Search**
button instead of the **Go** button, [our search
engine](/wiki/Wikipedia:Searching "wikilink") will do its best to help you
along. If that doesn't work well for you, you could try an [external
search engine](/wiki/Wikipedia:Searching#External_search_engines "wikilink").

Popular search engines, such as [AltaVista](/wiki/AltaVista "wikilink"),
[Google](/wiki/Google "wikilink"), or [Yahoo](Yahoo "wikilink") may return
better results and have more powerful search commands than the version
of [MediaWiki](/wiki/MediaWiki "wikilink") used for Wikipedia. Sometimes
Wikipedia search capabilities are curtailed to allow for faster response
time.

For example, on Google, adding a space and the word wikipedia to the end
of a web search query is likely to find relevant wikipedia pages.

Disambiguation and redirection
------------------------------

You may type in something like [Plaque](/wiki/Plaque "wikilink"), which takes
you to a list of the many things you could mean by it. This is called a
[disambiguation page](/wiki/Wikipedia:Disambiguation "wikilink"), and it's
there to make things easier for you. If it wasn't for that, you'd have
to read our minds and know exactly what multiword phrase we'd thought of
for each possible meaning of a common word or phrase.

Some things can be called by many names. The [Flag of the United
States](/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), for instance, could be
called the [American Flag](/wiki/American_Flag "wikilink"), the [US
Flag](/wiki/US_Flag "wikilink"), or any of a dozen similar things. In this
case, if you type any of those in, you will be
[redirected](/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirect "wikilink") to the proper place. (You're
welcome.) If instead of being redirected you're taken to a search menu,
that means that no editor has anticipated the way you phrased what you
were looking. In that case, just try another word or wording, or try
something related like [Flag](/wiki/Flag "wikilink") or [USA](USA "wikilink").
Once you have found what you were looking for, consider adding [redirect
pages](/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirect "wikilink") for the expressions you tried that
didn't turn up anything. Chances are you're not the only one thinking
about it this way, so you'll make life easier for those after you.

Search box location
-------------------

It's possible, due to a different [skin](/wiki/Wikipedia:Skin "wikilink") or
unusual display device, that the search box will not be on the left.
Just look around the screen and you'll find it.
