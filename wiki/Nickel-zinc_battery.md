The **nickel-zinc battery** (sometimes abbreviated **NiZn**) is a type
of [rechargeable battery](rechargeable_battery "wikilink") commonly used
in the light [electric vehicle](electric_vehicle "wikilink") sector.

It was invented by an [Irish](/wiki/Irish_people "wikilink") chemist, Dr
[James J. Drumm](/wiki/James_J._Drumm "wikilink") (1897-1974)[1] and installed
in a [railcar](railcar "wikilink") in 1932 for use on the
[Dublin](/wiki/Dublin "wikilink")-[Bray](Bray "wikilink") line. It was
apparently successful and it is not known why the idea was not further
developed at the time.

The battery is still not commonly found in the [mass
market](mass_market "wikilink"), but they are considered as the next
generation batteries used for high drain applications, and is expected
to replace [lead-acid batteries](lead-acid_batteries "wikilink") because
of their higher energy to mass ratio and higher power to mass ratio (up
to 75% lighter for the same power), and are relatively cheap compared to
[nickel-cadmium batteries](nickel-cadmium_batteries "wikilink")
(expected to be priced somewhere in between NiCd and lead-acids, but
have twice the energy storing capacity).
