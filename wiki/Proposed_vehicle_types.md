Three Wheelers
--------------

-   Jerry Dycus's [Freedom EV](/wiki/Freedom_EV "wikilink")
-   [3 Wheeler site](http://www.3wheelers.com/enter.html) As the tag
    line says "The online A-Z of 3-Wheelers".
-   [Three Wheel Cars](http://www.rqriley.com/3-wheel.htm) narrative by
    Robert Q. Riley. Subtitle is, "Primary Factors That Determine
    Handling & Rollover Characteristics"
-   [Tryanne II](http://home.clara.net/peterfrost/tryaneii.html) three
    wheeled, strip laid wooden three wheeler.
-   danz' proposed first product effort: 3 wheeler, enclosed, 2 people,
    room for groceries or some bags of peat moss, a flat roof on which I
    can tie 2X4s, or a 4X8 sheet of plywood or drywall. 30 mile range,
    60 mph max, integral trailer hitch for a 'pusher' or a gen set
    trailer or even a small cargo trailer. Lowest cost possible
    consistent with safety, reliability, comfort and (some)convenience.
    Aerodynamically unimportant--whatever is necessary to get the speed
    and the range despite inefficiencies: more batteries, larger vehicle
    envelope, etc.
