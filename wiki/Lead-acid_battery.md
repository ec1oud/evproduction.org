**Lead-acid batteries**, invented in 1859 by [French](/wiki/France "wikilink")
[physicist](physicist "wikilink") [Gaston
Planté](/wiki/Gaston_Planté "wikilink"), are the oldest type of [rechargeable
battery](secondary_battery "wikilink"). Despite having the second lowest
[energy](energy "wikilink")-to-[weight](weight "wikilink") ratio (next
to the [nickel-iron battery](nickel-iron_battery "wikilink")) and a
correspondingly low energy-to-[volume](volume "wikilink") ratio, their
ability to supply high [surge currents](surge_current "wikilink") means
that the cells maintain a relatively large [power-to-weight
ratio](power-to-weight_ratio "wikilink"). This, along with their low
cost, makes them ideal for use in [cars](cars "wikilink"), as they can
provide the high current required by [automobile starter
motors](/wiki/Automobile_self_starter "wikilink"). They are also used in
vehicles such as [forklifts](forklift "wikilink"), in which the low
energy-to-weight ratio may in fact be considered a benefit since the
battery can be used as a [counterweight](counterweight "wikilink").
Large arrays of lead-acid cells are used as standby power sources for
telecommunications facilities, generating stations, and computer data
centers.

Electrochemistry
----------------

Each cell contains (in the charged state) electrodes of
[lead](lead "wikilink") metal (Pb) and [lead (IV)
oxide](lead_dioxide "wikilink") (PbO<sub>2</sub>) in an
[electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink") of about 37% (5.99 Molar) *w*/*w*
[sulfuric acid](sulfuric_acid "wikilink") (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).
In the discharged state both electrodes turn into [lead(II)
sulfate](lead(II)_sulfate "wikilink") (PbSO<sub>4</sub>) and the
electrolyte loses its dissolved sulfuric acid and becomes primarily
[water](water "wikilink"). Due to the [freezing-point
depression](freezing-point_depression "wikilink") of water, as the
battery discharges and the concentration of sulfuric acid decreases, the
electrolyte is more likely to freeze.

The chemical reactions are (charged to discharged):

Anode (oxidation):
Pb(*s*) + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>(*a**q*) ↔ PbSO<sub>4</sub>(*s*) + 2*e*<sup>−</sup> *ϵ*<sup>*o*</sup> = 0.356 *V*

Cathode (reduction):
PbO<sub>2</sub>(*s*) + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>(*a**q*) + 4H<sup>+</sup> + 2*e*<sup>−</sup> ↔ PbSO<sub>4</sub>(*s*) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(*l*) *ϵ*<sup>*o*</sup> = 1.685 *V*

Because of the open cells with liquid electrolyte in most lead-acid
batteries, overcharging with excessive charging voltages will generate
[oxygen](oxygen "wikilink") and [hydrogen](hydrogen "wikilink") gas by
[electrolysis of water](electrolysis_of_water "wikilink"), forming an
[explosive mix](explosive_limit "wikilink"). This should be avoided.
Caution must also be observed because of the extremely corrosive nature
of sulfuric acid.

Practical cells are usually not made with pure lead but have small
amounts of [antimony](antimony "wikilink"), [tin](tin "wikilink"), or
[calcium](calcium "wikilink") alloyed in the plate material.

The following are general voltage ranges for six-cell lead-acid
batteries:

-   Open-circuit (quiescent) at full charge: 12.6 - 12.8 V
-   Open-circuit at full discharge: 11.8 - 12.0 V
-   Loaded at full discharge: 10.5 V.
-   Continuous-preservation (float) charging: 13.8V for gelled
    electrolyte; 13.4V for flooded; and 13.5V for AGM (Absorbed Glass
    Mat)

1.  All voltages are at 20C, and must be be adjusted for temperature
    changes.
2.  Float voltage recommendations vary, always check manufacturers'
    recommendation.
3.  Precise (+/- 0.05V) float voltage IS critical to longevity; too low
    (sulfation) is almost as bad as too high (corrosion & electrolyte
    loss)

-   Typical (daily) charging: 14.2 - 14.5 V (check manufacturer's
    recommendation)
-   Equalization charging (for flooded lead acids): 15 - 16 V
-   Gassing threshold: 14.4 V
-   After full charge the terminal voltage will drop quickly to 13.2 V
    and then slowly to 12.6 V.

Construction of battery
-----------------------

### Plates

The principle of the lead acid cell can be demonstrated with simple
sheet lead plates for the two electrodes. However such a construction
would only produce around an amp for roughly postcard sized plates, and
it would not produce such a current for more than a few minutes.

Planté realised that a plate construction was required that gave a much
larger effective surface area. Planté's method of producing the plates
has been largely unchanged.

A plate consists of a rectangular lead plate alloyed with a little
antimony to improve the mechanical characteristics. The plate is in fact
a grid with rectangular holes in it, the lead forming thin walls to the
holes. The holes are filled with a mixture of red lead and 33% dilute
sulphuric acid (Different manufacturers have modified the mixture). The
paste is pressed into the holes in the plates which are slightly tapered
on both sides to assist in retention of the paste. This paste remains
porous and allows the acid to react with the lead inside the plate
increasing the surface area many fold. At this stage the positive and
negative plates are identical. Once dry the plates are then stacked
together with suitable separators and inserted in the battery container.
An odd number of plates is always used, with one more negative plate
than positive. Each alternate plate is connected together. After the
acid has been added to the cell, the cell is given its first forming
charge. The positive plates gradually turn the chocolate brown colour of
Lead Dioxide, and the negative turn the slate gray of 'spongy' lead.
Such a cell is ready to be used.

Many modern manufacturers use pastes in the plates made directly from
Lead Dioxide and Lead, thus avoiding the necessity to form the plates.
Once acid is added, the cell is ready for use.

One of the problems with the plates in a lead-acid battery is that the
plates change size as the battery charges and discharges, the plates
increasing in size as the active material absorbs sulphate from the acid
during discharge, and decreasing as they give up the sulphate during
charging. This causes the plates to gradually shed the paste during
their life. It is important that there is plenty of room underneath the
plates to catch this shed material. If this material reaches the plates
a shorted cell will occur.

Separators
----------

Separators are used between the positive and negative plates of a lead
acid battery to prevent short circuit through physical contact, mostly
through Dendrites (‘treeing’), but also through shredded active
material. Separators cause some obstructions for the flow of ions i.e.
electricity between the electrodes. Separators therefore must have the
following characteristics:

1.  They must be porous—high porosity gives a high rate of flow of ions.
2.  Pore size must be small enough to restrict the flow of colloid
    particles but not restrict the ions.
3.  They must be as thin as possible.
4.  Electrical resistance must be very high.
5.  The area of the separator must be a little larger than the area of
    the plates to prevent material shorting between the plates.

To balance these criteria, the choice of separator shifted from wood to
rubber to glass mat to cellulose based separators to sintered PVC
separator to microporous PVC/polyethylene separator. An effective
separator must meet a number of mechanical properties. Permeability,
porosity, pore size distribution, specific surface area, mechanical
design and strength, Electrical resistance, ionic conductivity, and
chemical compatibility with the electrolyte. In service the separator
must have good resistance to acid and oxidation.

In the battery service condition the following reaction can be shown :

  
PbO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sup>+</sup> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> =
PbSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + ½ O<sub>2</sub>

PbO<sub>2</sub> + (oxidizable separator material) +
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = PbSO<sub>4</sub> + (oxidized material)

Moreover, the battery service temperature can be as high as 70 to 80
degrees Celsius. The separator must be capable of resisting thermal
degradation as far as possible.

Classification of lead acid batteries
-------------------------------------

### By production technology

-   Flooded/Wet cell batteries
-   VRLA: Valve Regulated Lead Acid batteries
-   AGM: Absorbed Glass Mat batteries
-   Gel cell batteries

### By application

-   Starter batteries
-   Stand-by (stationary) batteries
-   Traction (propulsion)batteries

Other applications
------------------

Wet cells designed for deep discharge are commonly used in [golf
carts](golf_cart "wikilink") and other [battery electric
vehicles](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink"), large backup power
supplies for telephone and computer centers and off-grid household
electric power systems.

Gel cells are used in back-up power supplies for alarm and smaller
computer systems (particularly in uninterruptible power supplies) and
for electric scooters, electrified bicycles and marine applications.
Unlike wet cells, gel cells are sealed, so they are less prone to
spilling and do not require maintenance of electrolyte levels.

[Absorbed glass mat](/wiki/Absorbed_glass_mat "wikilink") (AGM) cells are also
sealed and used in battery electric vehicles, as well as applications
where there is a fairly high risk of the battery being laid on its side
or over-turned, such as motorcycles.

Historically, lead-acid batteries were used to supply the filament
(heater) voltage (usually between 2 and 12 volts with 6 V being most
common) in [vacuum tube](vacuum_tube "wikilink") (valve) radio receivers
in areas where no mains electricity supply was available. Such radios
typically used two batteries: a lead-acid ["A"
battery](/wiki/A_battery_(vacuum_tubes) "wikilink") for the filament voltage
and a higher voltage (45 V–120 V) "dry" non-rechargeable ["B"
battery](/wiki/B_battery_(vacuum_tubes) "wikilink") for the plate (anode)
voltage. A few sets also used a third (3 V–9 V with several taps) "dry"
non-rechargeable ["C" battery](/wiki/C_battery_(vacuum_tubes) "wikilink") for
grid bias.

Lead-acid batteries are used in emergency lighting in case of [power
failure](power_failure "wikilink").

Starting batteries decay with deep discharges
---------------------------------------------

Lead acid batteries designed for starting service, such as those used in
most automobiles, are not designed for deep discharge. They have a large
number of thin plates designed for maximum surface area, and therefore
maximum current output, but which can easily be damaged by deep
discharge. Repeated deep discharges will result in capacity loss and
ultimately in premature failure, as the electrodes disintegrate due to
mechanical stresses that arise from cycling. A common misconception is
that starting batteries should always be kept on float charge. In
reality, this practice will encourage corrosion in the electrodes and
result in premature failure. Starting batteries should be kept
open-circuit but charged regularly (at least once every two weeks) to
prevent sulfation.

Deep cycle batteries
--------------------

Specially designed deep-cycle cells are much less susceptible to
degradation due to cycling, and are required for applications where the
batteries are regularly discharged, such as
[photovoltaic](photovoltaic "wikilink") systems, electric vehicle
(forklift, golf cart and other) and [uninterruptible power
supplies](uninterruptible_power_supplies "wikilink"). These batteries
have thicker plates that can deliver less peak current, but can
withstand frequent discharging.[1]

Marine batteries are something of a compromise between the two, able to
be discharged to a greater degree than automotive batteries, but less so
than deep cycle batteries.

MF (Maintenance Free) batteries
-------------------------------

The **MF (Maintenance Free) battery** is one of many types of lead-acid
battery.

It became popular on [motorcycles](motorcycles "wikilink") because its
acid is absorbed into the medium which separates the plates, so it
cannot spill, and this medium also lends support to the plates which
helps them better to withstand vibration.

The electrical characteristics of MF batteries differ somewhat from
wet-cell lead-acid batteries, and caution should be exercised in
charging and discharging them. MF batteries should not be confused with
AGM (Absorbed Glass Mat) batteries, which also have an absorbed
[electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink") but again have different
electrical characteristics.

Exploding Batteries
-------------------

MF Batteries rely on valves fitted to each cell which can vent hydrogen
if over-pressurisation occurs. Generally [oxygen](oxygen "wikilink") and
[hydrogen](hydrogen "wikilink") recombine in the space above the
electrolyte so that over-pressurisation rarely occurs. Should such a
condition occur and the valves fail to operate (through being blocked
for example), then there is a possibility of an internal
[explosion](explosion "wikilink") if the oxygen-hydrogen mixture is
ignited. Just a slight jolt can cause a spark to jump between the posts,
and the gas explodes. Personal injuries can result. The condition can be
assessed if any swelling in the cell walls of the battery are visible.
The swelling from internal pressurisation varies from cell to cell, that
at the battery ends being most obvious. Such batteries should be
isolated and carefully discarded, using protective personal equipment
(goggles, overalls, gloves etc) during the handling.

Environmental concerns
----------------------

Currently attempts are being made to develop alternatives to the
lead-acid battery (particularly for automotive use) because of concerns
about the environmental consequences of improper disposal of old
batteries. Lead-acid battery [recycling](recycling "wikilink") is one of
the most successful recycling programs in the world, with over 97% of
all battery lead recycled between 1997 and 2001.[2] Effective Lead
pollution control system is a necessity for sustainable environment.
There is a continuous improvement in battery
[recycling](recycling "wikilink") plants and furnace designs for greater
efficiencies. These recycling plants are ecology friendly as they follow
all [emission](emission "wikilink") standards for lead smelters, but new
methods should be devised or alternatives developed to the lead-acid
battery so that lead pollution can be reduced to an essentially
negligible amount.

Additives
---------

Many vendors sell chemical additives (solid compounds as well as liquid
solutions) that supposedly reduce sulfate build up and improve battery
condition when added to the electrolyte of a vented lead-acid battery.
Such treatments are rarely, if ever, effective.

Two compounds used for such purposes are [Epsom
salts](/wiki/Epsom_salts "wikilink") and [EDTA](EDTA "wikilink"). Epsom salts
reduce the internal resistance in a weak or damaged battery and may
allow a small amount of extended life. EDTA can be used to dissolve the
[sulphate](sulphate "wikilink") deposits of heavily discharged plates.
However, the dissolved material is then no longer available to
participate in the normal charge/discharge cycle, so a battery
temporarily revived with EDTA should not be expected to have normal life
expectancy. Residual EDTA in the lead-acid cell forms organic acids
which will accelerate corrosion of the lead plates and internal
connectors.

Active material (the positive plate lead peroxide and negative plate
spongy lead) changes physical form during discharge, resulting in plate
growth, distortion of the active material, and shedding of active
material. Once the active material has left the plates, it cannot be
restored into position by any chemical treatment. Similarly, internal
physical problems such as cracked plates, corroded connectors, or
damaged separators cannot be restored chemically.
