'''OScar''' is the first attempt to design an entire car (nowadays, also extended to other vechicles - [[bus]], [[truck]] and [[motorcycle]]) using [[open source]] principles. The aim of the project is mainly to produce [[blueprint]]s, using essentially open source [[CAD]]. The project is still far from producing a real car, but the progress has been continuous for some years.

The Goal of the project is not to produce a sophisticated car, but rather a simple and functional basic one, which answer basic people's transportation needs. A long term goal is also to introduce [[standardization]] in [[auto part|parts]] manufacturing (very much in the open source way) to use [[economies of scale]]. This is a radical change from the car industry current practices and [[business model]], where every manufacturer has his own standards. This monopoly on brand specific parts often constitutes an important part of the manufacturers' revenues.

Among the challenges this car will have to overcome, before reaching the manufacturing phase, is conducting [[crash test]]s and also abiding by very strict security legislation and [[pollution]] norms in the car industry. In this way, has been proposed [[low-carbon]] [[alternative propulsion]] OScars ([[petroleum electric hybrid vehicle|hybrid]], [[hydrogen vehicle]] and [[battery-electric vehicle|electric]] versions).
