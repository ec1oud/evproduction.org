A '''plug-in hybrid [[electric vehicle]]''' (PHEV) is a [[hybrid vehicle]] with onboard energy storage that can be recharged by connecting a plug to an [[Electricity generation|electrical power source]]. Plug-in hybrids have characteristics of both conventional [[Petroleum electric hybrid vehicle|hybrid electric vehicles]] and of [[battery electric vehicle]]s. While PHEVs are usually passenger vehicles, they can also be commercial passenger vans,<ref name="uvett">{{cite web | title=Hybrid Daily | work=Micro-Vett | url=http://www.micro-vett.it/english/bimodaleing.html | accessdate=April 21 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> utility trucks,<ref>Green Car Congress: [http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/02/epri_ford_and_e.html ''EPRI, Ford and Eaton Developing Plug-in Hybrid Utility Trouble Truck''] accessed April 23, 2007</ref><ref>Odyne Corporation press release: [http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/index.jspndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070503005702&newsLang=en&ndmConfigId=1001382&vnsId= Odyne Corp.

Plug-in hybrids use no [[fossil fuel]] during their [[all-electric range]] to the extent that their batteries are charged from sources such as [[wind power]], [[hydropower]], or [[nuclear energy]]. As of 2007, the cost for electricity to power plug-in hybrids during all-electric operation  in California has been estimated as less than one fourth the cost of gasoline.<ref name="hevctr">HEV Center (2007) [http://www.team-fate.net/phev.html "What are Plug-In Hybrids?"] Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering, UC Davis; retrieved 18 April 2007</ref> PHEVs also have the potential to help reduce [[air pollution]] as well as dependence on [[petroleum]] and help mitigate [[global warming]] by producing less [[greenhouse gases]] than conventional vehicles.  Other potential benefits include improved national [[energy security]], fewer fill-ups at the gas station, the convenience of home recharging, opportunities to provide emergency backup power in the home, and the potential for [[vehicle to grid]] applications.<ref>Simpson, A.

As of April 2007, plug-in hybrid passenger vehicles are not yet in production.  However, [[Toyota]]<ref name="toyota">{{cite news | last=Thomas | first=Ken | title=Toyota charging ahead with plans for plug-in hybrid | date=[[19 July]], [[2006]] | publisher=Chicago Sun-Times/Associated Press| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060719/ai_n16541548 }}</ref> and [[General Motors]]<ref name="gm2009">General Motors (11/29/2006) [http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=24308 ''GM Announces Intention to Produce Plug-in Hybrid SUV''] ''WebWire'' internet press release</ref> may introduce production PHEV automobiles as early as 2009. Conversions of production model [[hybrid vehicle]]s are available from conversion kits and conversion services. Many existing PHEVs are conversions of 2004+ [[Toyota Prius]] hybrid cars, which extend their electric-only range and add plug-in charging.

A plug-in hybrid's [[all-electric range]] is designated by PHEV-(miles) or PHEV(kilometers)km representing the distance the vehicle can travel on electric power alone.  For example, a PHEV-20 can travel twenty miles without using its internal combustion engine, or about 32 kilometers, so it may also be designated as PHEV32km.

==History==

===1899-1999===

[[Hybrid vehicles]] were produced beginning as early as 1899 by Lohner-[[Porsche]]. Early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation. However, the term "plug-in hybrid" has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical wall socket.

The July 1969 issue of [[Popular Science]] featured an article on the [[General Motors XP-883]] plug-in hybrid.  The concept commuter vehicle housed six 12-volt lead acid batteries in the trunk area and a transverse-mounted DC electric motor turning a front-wheel drive trans-axle.  The gasoline powered engine was connected to the trans-axle via a worm gear.<ref>Popular Science (July, 1969) [http://www.finkbuilt.com/blog/hybrid-car-ready-in-1969 "Hybrid Car Ready in 1969"] pp. 86-7</ref>  The car could be plugged into a standard 110 Volt AC outlet for recharging.

The September 1975 issue of [[Popular Science]] [http://www.popsci.com/popsci/automotivetech/c45d3bcc2eb84010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html featured] a cover story on an experimental  "turbo-electric" hybrid that "plugs in overnight for thrifty driving around town." Built by electronics engineer Harry Grepke, the vehicle used eight 12-volt truck batteries and a turbine genset. Grepke claimed an [[all-electric range]] of 50 miles.<ref> Popular Science, September 1975: [http://www.popsci.com/popsci/printerfriendly/automotivetech/1d7d3bcc2eb84010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html ''Loking Back'']</ref>

In 1989, [[Audi]] produced its first iteration of the Audi Duo, a plug-in parallel hybrid based on the [[Audi 100]] Avant [[Quattro]]. This car had a 12.6 bhp [[Siemens]] [[electric motor]] which drove the rear wheels. A trunk-mounted [[nickel]]-[[cadmium]] battery supplied [[energy]] to the motor that drove the rear wheels. The vehicle's front wheels were powered by a 2.3-litre five-cylinder engine with an output of 136 bhp. The intent was to produce a vehicle which could operate on the engine in the country and electric mode in the city. Mode of operation could be selected by the driver. Just ten vehicles are believed to have been made; one drawback was that due to the extra weight of the electric drive, the vehicles were less efficient when running on their engines alone than standard Audi 100s with the same engine.

Beginning around 1990, Professor [[Andrew A. Frank|Andy Frank]] of the [[University of California, Davis]] began using student teams to build operational prototype Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.  His work attracted industry support and funding from [[Nissan]], [[Koyo Seiko]], [[General Motors]], [[Saturn]], [[Ford]], [[Visteon]], JATCO, [[Ovonics]], the [[Defense Advanced Research Project Agency]] (DARPA), [[Sacramento Municipal Utility District]], [[Southern California Edison]], the [[United States Department of Energy]], and others.  The UC Davis PHEVs won several DOE/USCAR "Future Car" and "Future Truck" national competitions.  

In 1994, the [[ Esoro H301]] two-door, four passenger plug-in hybrid sedan was built in [[Switzerland]] by the vehicle prototyping company [[Esoro AG]].<ref>Esoro AG: [http://www.esoro.ch/english/content/kernk/nhanst/h301/h.htm "The First Hypercar"] ''www.esoro.ch'' retrieved 2007</ref> Four such prototypes are still on the road. The lightweight (710 kg/1565 lb) vehicle featured a 360cc engine in parallel with a 34 kW air-cooled AC [[induction motor]]. The 9 kWh nickel-cadmium battery could be recharged in four hours from a 220v electrical wall outlet, or from 30% to 80% [[state of charge]] in about two hours at a steady speed of 120km/h.<ref>Esoro AG: [http://www.esoro.ch/deutsch/content/kernk/bilder/nachhaltige/TWINTRAK.pdf "Twin Trak - a compact hybrid drive"] accessed April 22, 2007</ref> 

In 1998, Audi premiered a second iteration of the Duo plug-in hybrid, based on the [[Audi A4]], at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]].  The 1998 Audi Duo featured a parallel configuration similar to its predecessor. At the time, hybrid propulsion was considered as a promising solution to Europe's inner city emissions problems. Audi AG leased ten Duo PHEVs to Solarmobilverein Erlangen in the city of [[Erlangen]], [[Bavaria]] as part of ELCIDIS ('''El'''ectric Vehicle '''Ci'''ty '''Dis'''tribution), an advanced mobility project funded by the [[European Commission]].<ref>Vermie, T. (2002) [http://www.elcidis.org/elcidisfinal.pdf ELCIDIS Final Report"] European Commission Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development Programme technical report</ref>  Solar recharging stations were envisioned, but were not built. The fleet trial ended in August 2001. 

About sixty 1998-1999 Audi Duo PHEVs were built. However, few customers were prepared to pay twice the price as the base model A4 equipped with an identical diesel engine, and series production was stopped.

===2000-2005===

;2000 

The [[Electric Power Research Institute]] (EPRI) sponsored the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Alliance to promote and develop [[original equipment manufacturer]] commercialization of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Alliance members include major automakers, national labs, utilities, and the University of California at Davis.  [[EPRI]]'s Hybrid Electric Vehicle Working Group published reports on PHEV attractiveness.  Dr. Frank received new support from the [[European Commission]], Southern California Air Quality Management District, Yolo-Solano  Air Quality Management District, [[California Air Resources Board]], and other governmental agencies.

;2001

The U.S. [[Department of Energy]] created the National Center of Hybrid Excellence at UC Davis, with Dr. Frank as Director. Dr. Frank also obtained substantial GM funds to hybridize and plug-in GM's EV1.[[EPRI]]'s Hybrid Electric Vehicle Working Group (HEVWG) published a report on costs and efficiencies of hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles.<ref>Electric Power Research Institute (July 2002) [http://www.evworld.com/library/EPRI_sedan_options.pdf "Comparing the Benefits and Impacts of Hybrid Electric Vehicle Options"] technical report, accessed 27 April 2007</ref> The report evaluated a small car, a midsize car, and an SUV, and simulated four powertrains for each vehicle: a conventional powertrain, a parallel HEV, a PHEV-20, and a PHEV-60.

;2002

Entrepreneurs, environmentalists and engineers created the [[California Cars Initiative]] [http://www.calcars.org/ (www.calcars.org.)] CalCars is a non-profit PHEV advocacy and technology development group.

;2003

Renault began selling the Elect'Road, a plug-in series hybrid version of their popular [[Kangoo]], in Europe. It was sold alongside Renault's "Electri'cite" electric-drive Kangoo battery electric van. The Elect'Road had a 150 km range using a [[nickel-cadmium battery]] pack and a 500cc, 16 kW liquid-cooled gasoline "range-extender" engine. It powered two high voltage/high output/low volume alternators, each of which supplied up to 5.5kW at 132V at 5000 rpm. The operating speed of the internal combustion engine (and therefore the output delivered by the generators) varied according to demand. The fuel tank had a capacity of 10 litres and was housed within the right rear wheel arch. The range extender function was activated by a switch on the dashboard. The on board 3.5kW charger could charge a delpted battery pack to 95% SOC in about four hours from 220 volts. Passenger compartment heat was powered by the battery pack as well as an auxiliary coolant circuit that was heated by the range extender engine. Renault discontinued the Elect'Road after selling about 500, primarily in France, Norway and the UK, for about 25,000 euros.<ref>Renault (March 10, 2003) [http://www.calcars.org/KangooRangeExtend.pdf "Kangoo reinvents the electric car"] press release</ref>

With support from the [[Southern California Air Quality Management District]], the [[California Air Resources Board]], the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]], the [[Electric Power Research Institute]], and [[Volkswagen]], Alan Cocconi of [[AC Propulsion]] converted a [[Volkswagen Jetta]] into a plug-in series hybrid. The engine was replaced with a 120-kW electric motor and 8.7 kWh’s worth of lead-acid batteries, which were charged by a trunk-mounted 1.4-liter internal combustion engine from a [[Volkswagen Lupo]].<ref>[[http://www.evchargernews.com/miscfiles/evaosc111905.pdf ''AC Propulsion: Past, Present, and Future'']</ref>

In the same year, Professor Frank's vehicles were shown at the Paris International Auto Show and demonstrated to about 200 Renault engineers at its Paris headquarters.  During the same year, Toyota shipped a University of California Davis Coulomb Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles to [[Toyota City]] to demonstrate it to about 250 engineers and executives at two of [[Toyota]]'s primary Tier 1 suppliers, [[Koyo Seiko]], and Aisin AW (Aisin built the 1998-2003 [[Toyota Prius]] hybrid transaxle, as well as those used in the [[Ford Escape Hybrid]], [[Toyota Camry Hybrid]]. and Nissan Altima Hybrid). 

;2004

In September, the [[California Cars Initiative]] converted a 2004 Toyota Prius into a prototype of what it calls the PRIUS+. With the addition of 130 kg (300 lb) of [[lead-acid batteries]], the PRIUS+ achieved roughly double the gasoline [[mileage]] of a standard Prius and can make trips of up to 15 km (10 miles) using only electric power.<ref>{{cite web | title=How We Green-Tuned an '04 Prius into a PRIUS+ Plug-In Hybrid!| work=CalCars.com - The California Cars Initiative | url=http://www.priusplus.org | accessdate=January 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The vehicle, which is owned by CalCars technical lead Ron Gremban, is used in daily driving, as well as a test bed for various improvements to the system. 

Also in September, DaimlerChrysler displayed a plug-in hybrid version of its popular [[Mercedes-Benz]] Sprinter 311 CDI commercial van at the 2004 [[Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung]] Commercial Vehicle Show in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].<ref>DaimlerChrysler press release, 30 July 2004: [http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0,,0-5-7165-1-428612-1-0-0-0-0-0-1371-7165-0-0-0-0-0-0-0,00.html "Diesel engine combined with electric engine: Mercedes-Benz Sprinter now also with hybrid drive"] accessed April 23, 2007 </ref> The diesel-engine PHEV Sprinters had a maximum all electric range of 30 kilometers. Hand-built in [[Sindelfingen]], Germany by Mercedes-Benz, the vehicles were tested around the clock, and some were placed in commercial fleet environments. The PHEV Sprinter's engine could be turned off by the driver for operation in historic European city centers that had outlawed internal-combustion engines.

By the end of the year, Dr. Frank's student teams had built and operated seven proof-of-concept and proof-of-demonstration prototype Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles, including 6-passenger sedans (Taurus and Sable),  Sport Utility Vehicles (Suburban, Explorer), two-seater sports car (GM EV1), and two ground-up 80 mpg sports cars, and the CalCars PRIUS+ prototype and EDrive Systems conversions were demonstrated.

===Powertrains===

PHEVs are based on the same three basic [[powertrain]] architectures as conventional hybrids:

'''Series hybrids''' use an [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) to turn a generator, which in turn supplies current to an electric motor, which then rotates the vehicle’s drive wheels. A battery or capacitor pack, or a combination of the two, can be used as a buffer of sorts to store excess charge. Examples of series hybrids include Renault's Kangoo Elect'Road, Toyota's Japan-only Coaster light-duty passenger bus, DaimlerChrysler’s hybrid Orion bus (earlier post), the [[Chevrolet Volt]] concept vehicle, and many diesel-electric locomotives. With an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ICE.  As is the case for other architectures, '''series hybrids''' can operate without plugging in as long as there is liquid fuel in the tank.

'''Parallel hybrids''', such as Honda’s Insight, Civic, and Accord hybrids, can simultaneously transmit power to their drive wheels from two distinct sources—for example, an internal-combustion engine and a battery-powered electric drive. Although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle's engine and transmission, a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle's axles, while its electric motor drives the other axle. The Audi Duo Plug-in hybrid is an example of this type of parallel hybrid architecture. Parallel hybids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ICE at lower power demands and to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ICE than would normally be used, either mode substantially increasing fuel economy compared to a simple ICE vehicle.

'''Series-parallel hybrids''' have the flexibility to operate in either series or parallel mode. Hybrid powertrains currently used by Ford, Lexus, Nissan, and Toyota, which some refer to as “series-parallel with power-split,” can operate in both series and parallel mode at the same time. At present, most plug-in hybrid conversions of conventional hybrids untilize this architecture.

===Modes of operation===

Regardless of its architecture, a plug-in hybrid may be capable of [[charge-depleting]] and [[charge-sustaining]] modes.  Combinations of these two modes are termed [[blended mode]] or mixed-mode.  These vehicles can be designed to drive for an extended range in [[all-electric mode]], either at low speeds only or at all speeds. These modes manage the vehicle's battery discharge strategy, and their use has a direct effect on the size and type of battery required:<ref>Green Car Congress, September 29, 2006: [http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/09/plugins_progres.html ''Plug-ins Progess''] accessed 27 April 2007</ref>

'''Charge-depleting modes''' allow a fully charged PHEV to operate exclusively (or depending on the vehicle, almost exclusively, except during hard acceleration) on electric power alone until its battery state of charge is depleted to a predetermined level, at which time the vehicle's internal combustion engine or fuel cell will be engaged. This period is the vehicle's [[all-electric range]].  This is the only mode that a [[battery electric vehicle]] can operate in, thus their limited range.

'''Charge-sustaining modes''' are those used by production [[hybrid vehicles]] (HEV) today, and combine the operation of the vehicle's two power sources in such a manner that the vehicle is operating as efficiently as possible without allowing the battery state of charge to move beyond some predetermined narrow band.  Over the course of a trip in a HEV the state of charge may fluctuate but will have no net change.<ref>Tony Markel/[[NREL]]: [http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/symposium/presentations/markel.pdf "Plug-in HEV Vehicle Design Options and Expectations"] accessed 27 April 2007</ref>  The battery in a HEV can thus be thought of as an energy accumulator rather than a fuel storage device.  Once a plug-in hybrid has exhausted its all-electric range in charge-depleting mode, it can switch into charge-sustaining mode automatically.

'''Blended modes''' are a type of charge-depleting mode normally employed by vehicles which do not have enough electric power to sustain high speeds without the help of the internal combustion portion of the powertrain.  A blended control strategy typically takes more miles to use stored grid electricity than a charge-delpleting strategy.<ref>Santini ''et al.,'' September 27, 2006 : [http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/HV/386.pdf ''Energy and Petroleum Consumption Attributes of Plug-in Hybrids''], accessed 29 April 2007</ref> The [[Renault Kangoo]] and some Toyota Prius conversions are examples of vehicles that use this mode of operation.  The Electri'cité & Elect'road versions of the Relant Kangoo were charge-depleting battery electric vehicles; the Elect'road had a modest [[internal-combustion engine]] (ICE) which extended its range somewhat.  2004+ Toyota Prius conversions can only run without using the [[ICE]] at speeds of less than about 42 mph due to the limits dictates by the vehicle's powertrain control software, which resides in the Hybrid Vehicle Electronic Control Unit (HV ECU). However at speeds above this electric power can still be used to displace gas fuel thus improving the gas mileage when operating in this mode, generally doubling the MPG.

'''Mixed mode''' is a particular trip in which a combination of the above modes are utilized.<ref>EAA-PHEV wiki: [http://www.eaa-phev.org/wiki/Mixed-mode Mixed-mode] accessed 29 April 2007</ref>  For example, a PHEV-20 Prius conversion may begin a trip with 5 miles of low speed charge-depleting, then get onto a freeway and operate in blended mode for 20 miles, using 10 miles worth of of AER at twice the MPG. Finally the driver might exit the freeway and drive for another 5 miles without the ICE until the full 20 miles of AER were exhausted.  At this point the vehicle would revert back to a charge sustaining-mode for another 10 miles until the final destination is reached.  Such a trip would be considered a mixed mode, as multiple modes are employed in  one trip. This contrasts with a charge-depleting trip which would be driven within the limits of a PHEV's all electric range.  Conversely, the portion of a trip which extends beyond the AER of a PHEV would be driven primarily in charge-sustaining mode, much as a conventional hybrid.

===Batteries===

PHEVs typically require deeper [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] charging and discharging cycles than conventional hybrids. Because the number of full cycles influences battery lifetime, battery life may be less than in HEVs which use a smaller window of . However, some authors argue that PHEVs will soon become standard in the automobile industry.<ref>Roim, J. and Frank, A.

The cathodes of some early 2007 lithium-ion batteries are made from lithium-cobalt metal oxide. This material is expensive, and cells made with it can release oxygen if its cell is overcharged. If the cobalt is replaced with [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|iron phosphates]], the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge. The price premium for early 2007 hybrids is about US $5000, some $3000 of which is for their NiMH battery packs. At early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices, that would break even after six to ten years of operation. The hybrid premium could fall to $2000 in five years, with $1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries, providing a three-year payback.<ref name="ieee">Voelcker, J.

===Conversions of production hybrids ===

[[Image:WanacheBuild88large.JPG|thumb|right|300px|15 [[Lead acid battery|lead-acid batteries]], PFC charger, and [[battery regulator|regulators]] installed into [http://www.eaa-phev.org/wiki/WhiteBird WhiteBird], a PHEV-10 conversion of a Toyota Prius]]

Conversion of an existing production hybrid to a plug-in hybrid typically involves increasing the capacity of the vehicle's [[battery pack]] and adding an onboard AC-to-DC charger. Ideally, the vehicle's powertrain software would be reprogrammed to make full use of the battery pack's additional energy storage capacity and power output. 

Many early plug-in hybrid [[electric vehicle conversion]]s have been based on the 2004+ model year [[Toyota Prius]]. Some of the systems have involved replacement of the vehicle's original Ni-MH battery pack and its electronic control unit.  Others, such as Hymotion as well as builders of the CalCars Prius+, and the PiPrius, piggyback an additional battery back onto the OEM battery pack, this is also referred to as Battery Range Extender Modules (BREMs).<ref>CalCars-News group (2007) [http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/calcars-news/message/757 A123Systems Battery Co Acquires Hymotion Conversion Co]</ref> This has been referred to as a "hybrid battery pack configuration" within the [[electric vehicle conversion]] community.<ref>Electric Auto Association (2007) [http://www.eaa-phev.org/wiki/Battery_Pack_Configurations#Hybrid "Battery Pack Configurations"] ''Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle'' website, accessed 25 April 2007</ref> Early [[lead-acid battery]] conversions by CalCars demonstrated 10 miles (15 km) of EV-only and 20 miles (30 km) of double mileage [[blended mode]] range.

[http://www.edrivesystems.com EDrive systems] use [http://www.valence.com Valence] [[Lithium ion polymer battery|Li-ion]] batteries and have a claimed 40 to 50 miles of electric range.  Other companies offering plug-in conversions or kits for the Toyota Prius include [http://www.hymotion.com Hymotion], [[Hybrids Plus]], and [http://www.manzanitamicro.com Manzanita Micro].

The [http://www.eaa-phev.org EAA-PHEV project] was conceived in October of 2005 to accelerate efforts to document existing HEVs and their potential for conversion into PHEVs. The [[Electric Auto Association]]-PHEV "Do-It-Yourself" [[Open Source]] community's primary focus is to provide general information to curious parties and detailed conversion instruction to help guide experienced EV Converters through the process.  Many members of organizations such as [[CalCars]] and the EAA as well as companies like [[Hybrids Plus]], [http://www.hybridinterfaces.ca Hybrid Interfaces], and Manzanita Micro participate in the development of the project.

==Potential advantages==

===Improved fuel efficiency===

A 120 km (70-mile) range HEV-70 may annually require only about 25% as much gasoline as a similarly designed HEV-0, depending on how it will be driven and the trips for which will be used. A further advantage of PHEVs is that they have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because more limited use of the PHEV's internal combustion engines may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency. While a Prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30% efficiency (well below the engine's 38% peak efficiency) the engine of a PHEV-70 would likely operate far more often near its peak efficiency because it is not needed during transient operation conditions. These architectures would be highly likely to employ a parallel hybrid configuration whereby mechanical engine power is allowed to transfer most efficiently directly to the wheels (when the engine is activated).

===Reduced greenhouse gas emissions===

Another potential advantage of PHEVs is a predicted reduction in [[carbon emissions]] should PHEV use become widespread. Increased drivetrain efficiency results in significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, even taking into account energy lost to inefficiency in the production and distribution of grid power and charging of batteries. A study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE)  predicts that, on average, a typical American driver is expected to achieve about a 15% reduction in net [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions compared to a regular hybrid, based on the 2005 distribution of power sources feeding the US electrical grid. Additionally, for PHEV’s recharged in areas where the grid is fed by power sources with lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than the current average, net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with PHEVs will decrease correspondingly.  

The same study predicts that in areas where more than 80% of grid-power comes from coal-burning power plants, local net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will increase.<ref>Kliesch, J. and Langer, T. (September 2006) [http://www.aceee.org/store/proddetail.cfm?CFID=1941952&CFTOKEN=35186425&ItemID=418&CategoryID=7   "Plug-In Hybrids: an Environmental and Economic Performance Outlook"] American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy</ref>  However, given the global nature of problems associated with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, specifically those related to [[Global Warming|global warming]], localized increases in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are not considered a significant problem if global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are decreased.<ref name="reduct" />

===Reduced operating costs===

In California, as of 2006, the cost to plug in at night is equivalent to $0.75 per gallon of gasoline,<ref name="hevctr" /> where gasoline sells for over $3 per gallon The cost of electricity for a Prius PHEV is about $0.03/mi ($0.019/km), based on 0.262 kilowatt hours per mile and a cost of electricity of $0.10 per kilowatt hour.<ref>California Cars Initiative (April 20, 2006) [http://www.calcars.org/conversions-factsheet.pdf#search=%22Prius%20262%20kWh%20mile%22 "Fact Sheet: PHEV Conversions"] page 2, accessed 18 April 2006</ref><ref>Bluejay, M. (2006?) [http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/cost.html "How much does electricity cost?"] accessed 18 April 2007</ref> Current PHEV conversions install a higher capacity battery than common hybrids like the Toyota Prius in order to extend the range. This additional cost is offset by fuel operating cost savings because just $1.00 worth of electricity from the wall (at $0.09/kW·h) is sufficient to drive the same distance as a gallon of gasoline. During the year 2007, many government and industry researchers will focus on determining what level of all-electric range is economically optimum for the design.

===Vehicle-to-grid electricity features===

PHEVs and fully electric cars may allow for more efficient use of existing electric production capacity, much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time. This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during [[off peak]] periods (i.e., at night), or equipped with technology to shut off charging during periods of peak demand. Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads. This is accomplished with [[vehicle to grid]] technology. By using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power, such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities as well as their owners. Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of night time electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the day time, and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure.<ref name="reduct">James, W. (September 2006) [http://www.rise.org.au/pubs/Alt_Trans_Energ_Conf_WA_20060912.pdf "Large Oil and GHG Reductions with Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles"] ''Alternative Transport Energies Conference'' (Perth, Australia)</ref>

In October 2005, five Toyota engineers and one Aisin AW engineer published an [[IEEE]] technical paper detailing a Toyota-approved project to add vehicle to grid capability to a NHW20 Toyota Prius.<ref>Oyobe, H. ''et al.'' (2005) [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1518726 "Development of Ultra Low-Cost, High-Capacity Power Generation System Using Drive Motor and Inverter for Hybrid Vehicle"] ''Fortieth Industry Applications Conference Annual Meeting.'' accessed April 23, 2007</ref> Although the technical paper described "a method for generating voltage between respective lines of neutral points in the generator and motor of the THS-II (Toyota Hybrid System) to add a function for generating electricity", it did not state whether or not the experimental vehicle could be charged through the circuit, as well. However, the vehicle was featured in a Toyota Dream House, and a brochure for the exhibit stated that "the house can supply electricity to the battery packs of the vehicles via the stand in the middle of the garage", indicating that the vehicle may have been a plug-in hybrid.<ref>Green Car Congress (26 September 2005) [http://www.greencarcongress.com/2005/09/toyota_dream_ho.html "Toyota Dream House with Plug-In Prius"] accessed 23 April 2007</ref>

In November 2005, more than fifty public power leaders from across the nation met at [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] headquarters to discuss plug-in hybrid and vehicle-to-grid technology. The event, which was sponsored by the American Public Power Association, also provided a opportunity for association members to plan strategies that public power utility companies could use to promote plug-in hybrid technology. Greg Hanssen and Peter Nortman of EnergyCS and EDrive attended the two-day session, and during a break in the proceedings, made an impromptu display in the LADWP parking lot of their converted Prius plug-in hybrid.<ref>Green Car Congress (18 November 2005) [http://www.greencarcongress.com/2005/11/plugging_the_pl.html "Plugging the Plug-In Hybrid"] accessed 20 April 2007</ref>

From September 25 to 27, 2006  the {California Air Resources Board] held a Zero Emission Vehicle symposium that included several presentations on [[V2G]] technology.<ref>Green Car Congress, September 27, 2006:[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/09/the_plugin_and_.html#more ''The Plug-In and BEV Adoption Wild Card: Vehicle-to-Grid''] accessed April 28, 2007</ref>

In April 2007, [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] showcased a PHEV at the Silicon Valley Leadership Alternative Energy Solutions Summit with [[vehicle-to-grid]] capability, and demonstrated that they could be used as a source of emergency home power in the event of an electrical power failure.<ref>Green Car Congress (April 9, 2007) [http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/04/pge_demonstrate.html"PG&E Demonstrates Vehicle-to-Grid Technology"] accessed April 20, 2007</ref> Regulations intended to protect electricians against power other than from grid sources would need to be changed, or regulations requiring consumers to disconnect from the grid when connected to non-grid sources will be required before such backup power solutions would be feasible.<ref name="pge" /> ''See also: [[Net metering]]''

==Potential disadvantages==

Disadvantages of plug-in hybrids include the additional weight and cost of a larger battery pack. The fuel economy increase for a PHEV are highly dependent upon the way a vehicle is used (its [[duty cycle]]) and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid.  In the most extreme of circumstances a PHEV might get worse mileage than an HEV.  For example, in vehicles being used continuously without opportunities for recharging by connecting to the electrical grid the larger battery capacity (as compared to an HEV) might lack any advantage, while the greater battery weight (than in a corresponding HEV) would reduce fuel economy.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

The study by the ACEEE also predicts that widespread PHEV use in heavily coal-dependent areas would result in an increase in local net sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, given emissions levels from most coal plants currently supplying power to the grid.<ref>Clayton, M. (September 25, 2006) [http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0925/p03s02-usgn.html "A reality check on plug-in hybrids"] ''The Christian Science Monitor''</ref><ref>Kanellos, M. (April 28, 2006) [http://news.com.com/Plug+in+your+hybrid,+pollute+less/2100-11389_3-6066360.html "Plug in your hybrid, pollute less?"] ''cNet News.com''</ref> Although [[clean coal]] technologies could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants, the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricity dramatically. There is debate about whether or not PHEV or electric vehicle technology reduces pollution or simply shifts the pollution to another physical location.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} The net effect on pollution is dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid (fossil or renewable, for example) and the pollution profile of the powerplants themselves. Identifying, regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a powerplant -- or replacing a plant altogether -- may also be more practical. From a human health perspective, shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantage.

==Commercialization==

[[Image:New Vehicle Purchase Preference.gif|right|thumb|300px|The number of US survey respondents willing to pay $4,000 more for a plug-in hybrid car increased from 17% in 2005 to 26% in 2006.]]

Interest in plug-in hybrids increased in 2006 to such a level that the architecture was included as an area of research in President George W. Bush's advanced energy initiative and mentioned in his [[2007 State of the Union Address]].  After hearing an explanation of PHEVs, 49% of consumers surveyed in 2006 said they would consider purchasing one.  That is about the same level of interest as standard hybrid technology.<ref>Synovate (August 16, 2006) [http://www.synovate.com/current/news/article/2006/08/study-shows-strong-consumer-consideration-for-flex-fuel-vehicles-including-e85-plug-in-hybrids-peak-interest.html "Survey shows 49% of consumers would consider buying a plug-in hybrid"]</ref>

===Patent encumbrance of NiMH batteries===

In 1994, General Motors acquired a controlling interest in [[Ovonics]]'s battery development and manufacturing, including patents and trade secrets controlling the manufacturing of large [[Nickel metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries]]. In 2001, [[Texaco]] purchased GM's share in GM [[Ovonics]]. A few months later, Chevron acquired Texaco. In 2003, Texaco Ovonic Battery Systems was changed to [http://www.cobasys.com/solutions/technology.htm Cobasys], a 50/50 joint venture between Chevron and [[Energy_Conversion_Devices_Ovonics|Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) Ovonics]].<ref>Roberson, J.
