The term **solar panel** is best applied to a flat **[solar thermal
collector](solar_thermal_collector "wikilink")**, such as a [solar hot
water](solar_hot_water_panel "wikilink") or air panel used to heat
[water](solar_hot_water "wikilink"), air, or otherwise collect [solar
thermal energy](solar_thermal_energy "wikilink"). But 'solar panel' may
also refer to a **[photovoltaic module](/wiki/Photovoltaic_array "wikilink")**
which is an assembly of [solar cells](solar_cell "wikilink") used to
generate [electricity](electricity "wikilink"). In all cases, the panels
are typically flat, and are available in various heights and widths.

An **array** is a group of solar-thermal panels or photovoltaic (PV)
modules; the panels can be connected either in parallel or series
depending upon the design objective. Solar panels typically find use in
residential, commercial, institutional, and light industrial
applications.

Solar-thermal panels saw widespread use in Florida and California until
the 1920s when tank-type [water heaters](water_heater "wikilink")
replaced them. A thriving manufacturing business soon dwindled. However,
solar-thermal panels are still in production, and are common in portions
of the world where energy costs, and solar energy availability, are
high.

Recently there has been a surge toward large scale production of PV
modules. In parts of the world with significantly high
[insolation](insolation "wikilink") levels, PV output and their
economics are enhanced. PV modules are the primary component of most
small-scale solar-electric power generating facilities. Larger
facilities, such as [solar power
plants](/wiki/Solar_thermal_energy "wikilink") typically contain an array of
reflectors (concentrators), a receiver, and a thermodynamic power cycle,
and thus use solar-thermal rather than PV.

The largest solar panel in the world is under construction in the south
of [Portugal](/wiki/Portugal "wikilink"). A 116-megawatt facility covering a
250-hectare south-facing hillside in the southern
[Alentejo](/wiki/Alentejo "wikilink") region and it will produce electricity
for 25,000 households.[1]
