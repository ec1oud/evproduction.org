The **Honda Civic Hybrid** is a [hybrid](hybrid_electric "wikilink")
version of the [Honda Civic](/wiki/Honda_Civic "wikilink")
[sedan](sedan "wikilink").

For the 2003 model of the [Civic](/wiki/Honda_Civic "wikilink"),
[Honda](/wiki/Honda "wikilink") added a [continuously variable
transmission](continuously_variable_transmission "wikilink") and an
[Integrated Motor Assist](/wiki/Integrated_Motor_Assist "wikilink") hybrid
system similar to that of the [Insight](/wiki/Honda_Insight "wikilink"),
creating a fuel efficient hybrid [sedan](/wiki/Sedan_(car) "wikilink"). It is
an [assist
hybrid](/wiki/Hybrid_Vehicle_Drivetrains#Power_assist_hybrid "wikilink").
Along with the conventional Civic, it received updated styling for 2004.

It was redesigned in [2006](2006 "wikilink") and based off the new Civic
platform.

Technology
----------

### 1st Generation (2003-2005 Model)

![Interior of a 2005 Civic Hybrid (Australian
version)](CivichybridI.jpg "Interior of a 2005 Civic Hybrid (Australian version)")

-   1.3 L i-DSI [lean-burn](/wiki/Lean_burn "wikilink") [internal-combustion
    engine](internal-combustion_engine "wikilink") with
    [VTEC](/wiki/VTEC "wikilink") Cylinder Cut-off System, which allows up to
    three cylinders to cease operation during deceleration. This
    decreases friction losses generated by engine aspiration and allows
    more effective regeneration of energy.
-   15 kW (20 hp) brushless, permanent magnet assist
    [motor](electric_motor "wikilink"), which functions as a
    [generator](electrical_generator "wikilink") during deceleration and
    loads (recharges) batteries
-   120 V [Nickel-metal hydride](/wiki/NiMH "wikilink")
    [batteries](/wiki/Battery_(electricity) "wikilink") with 6.0 Ah capacity
-   [Multimatic S](/wiki/Honda_Multimatic_S "wikilink") continuously variable
    or 5-speed manual
    [transmission](transmission_(mechanics) "wikilink") (latter
    available only in USA)
-   [SULEV](/wiki/SULEV "wikilink") or optional [AT-PZEV](AT-PZEV "wikilink")
    certification by the [California Air Resources
    Board](/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board "wikilink") (CARB)
-   Low rolling resistance [tires](tire "wikilink") and [regenerative
    braking](regenerative_braking "wikilink")
-   [Electric power-steering](/wiki/Electric_power-steering "wikilink")
-   Does not need to be plugged in

### 2nd Generation (2006-2007 Model)

  
Note: only advancements specified, those items remaining the same not
mentioned.

-   4th generation IMA (Integrated Motor Assist)
-   1.3 L single-overhead-cam four-cylinder gas engine same as before;
    yet, there is now the addition of high profile camshaft. This
    increases power to 93 hp @ 6000 rpm
-   Addition of third stage of i-VTEC and VCM (Vehicle Cylinder
    Management) permits deactivation of all four cylinders when
    decelerating and constant cruising. This allows the car to run only
    on electric power for the first time.

<!-- -->

-   EPA increase to 49 mpg city, 51 mpg highway
