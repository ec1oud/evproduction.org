A golf cart is slow because it doesn't need to be any faster. A typical
one has 8 batteries, each providing 6 volts, for a total of 48 volts
(since they are wired in series). For a freeway-going car, of course you
need more than that. Something between 96 and 144 volts is reasonable,
if you still plan to use ordinary flooded lead-acid golf cart batteries
(they are still the most cost effective, if a tad old-fashioned these
days) and plan to use a DC motor. If you want to invest in an AC motor
and a 3-phase inverter with which to drive it, then you need several
hundred volts, and typically you will be using a larger quantity of
smaller batteries in that case (and will be spending quite a bit more
money too).

Unfortunately there is a legal classification for slow electric cars,
called the "Neighborhood Electric Vehicle" (NEV), and since these cars
are not required to meet a lot of stringent qualifications, pass a crash
test, and so on, the manufacturers are not afraid to produce and sell
them. These are just golf carts with a few extras, and are not what we
are talking about here.

Some well-known quick DC conversions
------------------------------------

These are ordinary back-yard conversions of everyday cars, built by
everyday people like you.

-   [White Zombie](http://www.plasmaboyracing.com/whitezombie.php) is a
    Datsun 1200 conversion that happens to run 12-second 1/4 mile races
-   [California Poppy](http://www.austinev.org/evalbum/293.html) is a
    car built by the engineer who has designed the best high-power DC
    motor controller so far
-   [Gone Postal](http://www.suckamps.com/index.php?page=projects) used
    to be a mail delivery van, and has been turned into an electric race
    car, just to turn heads at the track

    Electric Drag Racing Association](http://www.nedra.com/).

Some more exotic electric racers
--------------------------------

-   [T-Zero](http://www.acpropulsion.com/tzero_pages/tzero_home.htm) was
    designed as a test bed for AC inverter development, and runs from a
    pack of hundreds of laptop batteries. (They happen to have the best
    energy density, but wiring up that many into a single pack is a bit
    of work!)
-   [Current Eliminator](http://www.wurts.net/ElectrifiedMotorSports/)
    is currently the fastest electric dragster; runs 1/4 mile races in
    less than 9 seconds.
-   [The Buckeye
    Bullet](http://www.speedace.info/osu_buckeye_bullet.htm) holds the
    electric land speed record, at 314.958 mph.

An internal combustion engine must operate within a certain RPM range.
It must already be running, it cannot provide instant torque at the same
time that it is being started. And it has a redline, of course. And the
rated horsepower that the engine can deliver, is measured as a maximum,
and can be achieved at only one speed, the speed at which the engine is
the most efficient.

But an electric motor can provide instant torque, from a standstill. A
series-wound DC motor, in particular, actually provides the \*most\*
torque in preciesly that condition. So, a transmission is not necessary
in many of these race cars. A series-wound DC motor is ideal for drag
racing. The problem is not getting enough torque, but keeping the tires
stuck to the track rather than spinning out of control. If you can do
that, you're nearly guaranteed to get a quicker launch than any
gas-powered vehicle can muster.

The racers are constantly pushing out the limits of power, and figuring
out how to control more power; but for a street car, the design goals
are a bit different. You typically want to drive as far as possible
without needing to recharge the batteries too often. But that's mostly a
matter of carrying more batteries.
