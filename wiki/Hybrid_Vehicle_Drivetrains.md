[Petroleum electric Hybrid
vehicles](/wiki/Petroleum_electric_hybrid_vehicle "wikilink") make use of both
an on-board [rechargeable energy storage
system](rechargeable_energy_storage_system "wikilink") (RESS) and a
fueled power source for vehicle
[propulsion](/wiki/Ground_propulsion "wikilink"). There are many ways to
accomplish this.

Types by drivetrain structure
-----------------------------

### Parallel hybrid

<img src="Hybridpar.png" title="fig:Structure of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle" alt="Structure of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle" width="400" />
**Parallel hybrid** systems, which are most commonly produced at
present, have both an [internal combustion
engine](internal_combustion_engine "wikilink") and an [electric
motor](electric_motor "wikilink") connected to a mechanical
[transmission](/wiki/Transmission_%28mechanics%29 "wikilink"). Most designs
combine a large electrical generator and a motor into one unit, often
located between the combustion engine and the transmission, replacing
both the conventional [starter motor](starter_motor "wikilink") and the
[alternator](alternator "wikilink"). To store power, a large battery
pack is charged to a higher voltage than the normal automotive 12 volts.
Accessories such as power steering and air conditioning are powered by
electric motors instead of being attached to the combustion engine. This
allows efficiency gains as the accessories can run at a constant speed,
regardless of how fast the combustion engine is running.

Parallel hybrids can be categorized by the way the two sources of power
are mechanically coupled. If they are joined at some axis truly in
parallel, the speeds at this axis must be identical and the supplied
torques add together. Most electric bicycles are in effect of this type.
When only one of the two sources is being used, the other must either
also rotate in an idling manner or be connected by a one-way clutch or
freewheel. With cars it is more usual to join the two sources through a
differential gear. Thus the torques supplied must be the same and the
speeds add up, the exact ratio depending on the differential
characteristics. When only one of the two sources is being used, the
other must still supply a large part of the torque or be fitted with a
reverse one-way clutch or automatic clamp.

Parallel hybrids can be further categorized depending upon how balanced
the different portions are at providing motive power. In some cases, the
combustion engine is the dominant portion; the electric motor turns on
only when a boost is needed. Others can run with just the electric
system operating.

### Series hybrid

<img src="Hybridpeak.png" title="fig:Structure of a series hybrid vehicle" alt="Structure of a series hybrid vehicle" width="400" />
In a **series hybrid** system, the combustion engine drives an electric
generator instead of directly driving the wheels. The generator both
charges a battery and powers an electric motor that moves the vehicle.
When large amounts of power are required, the motor draws electricity
from both the batteries and the generator. A complex transmission is not
needed, as electric motors are efficient over a wide speed range. Some
vehicle designs have separate electric motors for each wheel. Series
hybrids can be also be fitted with a
[supercapacitor](supercapacitor "wikilink") or a
[flywheel](flywheel "wikilink"), which can improve efficiency by
minimizing the losses in the battery.

The advantage of a series hybrid is the lack of a mechanical link
between the combustion engine and the wheels. The combustion engine runs
at a constant and efficient rate, even as the car changes speed. During
stop-and-go city driving, series hybrids are relatively the most
efficient.

A weakness is that the power from the combustion engine has to run
through both the generator and electric motor. During long-distance
highway driving, the electrical transmission can be less efficient than
a conventional transmission.

The use of one motor per wheel eliminates the conventional mechanical
transmission elements (gearbox, transmission shafts, differential). If
the motors are integrated into the wheels, the unsprung mass increases,
decreasing ride performance. If the motors are attached to the vehicle
body, flexible couplings are required. Advantages of individual wheel
motors include simplified [traction
control](traction_control "wikilink") and [all wheel
drive](all_wheel_drive "wikilink"), and allowing lower floors, which is
useful for buses. Some 8x8 all-wheel drive military vehicles use
individual wheel motors.

### Combined hybrid

<img src="Hybridcombined.png" title="fig:Structure of a combined hybrid electric vehicle" alt="Structure of a combined hybrid electric vehicle" width="400" />
**Combined hybrid** systems have features of both series and parallel
hybrids. They incorporate power-split devices allowing for power paths
from the engine to the wheels that can be either mechanical or
electrical. The main principle behind this system is the decoupling of
the power supplied by the engine (or other primary source) from the
power demanded by the driver.

In a conventional vehicle, a larger engine is used to provide
acceleration from still than one needed for steady speed cruising. This
is because a combustion engine's torque is minimal at lower RPMs, as the
engine is its own air pump. On the other hand, an electric motor
exhibits maximum torque at stall and is well suited to complement the
engine's torque deficiency at low RPMs. In a combined hybrid, a smaller,
less flexible, and highly efficient engine can be used. It is often a
variation of the conventional [Otto cycle](/wiki/Otto_cycle "wikilink"), such
as the [Miller](/wiki/Miller_cycle "wikilink") or [Atkinson
cycle](/wiki/Atkinson_cycle "wikilink"). This contributes significantly to the
higher overall efficiency of the vehicle, with regenerative braking
playing a much smaller role.

Interesting variations of that simple theme, as very well known
(implemented in the Toyota Prius) are the

-   addition of a fixed gear second planetary gearset as used in the
    Lexus RX400h and Toyota Highlander Hybrid. This allows for a motor
    with less torque but higher power (and higher maximum rotary speed),
    ie. higher power density

<!-- -->

-   addition of a ravigneux-type planetary gear (planetary gear with 4
    shafts instead of 3) and two clutches as used in the Lexus GS450h.
    By switching the clutches, the gear ratio from MG2 (the "drive"
    motor) to the wheel shaft is switched, either for higher torque or
    higher speed (up to 250 km/h / 155 mph) while sustaining better
    transmission efficiency.

The Toyota Hybrid System THS / [Hybrid Synergy
Drive](/wiki/Hybrid_Synergy_Drive "wikilink") mode of operation with only a
single power split device (incorporated as a single 3 shaft planetary
gearset) is a typical example which can also be called Input-Split
Hybrid, due to the fact that a fixed amount of torque is transferred via
the electrical path from the engine to the wheels. This in turn makes
this setup very simple in mechanical terms, but does have some drawbacks
of its own. For example the maximum speed is mainly limited by the speed
of the smaller electric motor. Also, the efficiency of the transmission
is heavily dependent on the amount of power being transmitted over the
electrical path, as multiple conversions, each with their own, less than
perfect efficiency, lead to a low efficiency of that path (\~0.7)
compared with the purely mechanical path (\~0.98). Especially in higher
speed regimes (&gt;120 km/h or 70 mph) the efficiency (of the
transmission alone) therefore drops below that of a generic automatic
transmission with hydrodynamic coupler.

[General Motors](/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation "wikilink"),
[BMW](/wiki/BMW "wikilink"), and [DaimlerChrysler](/wiki/DaimlerChrysler "wikilink")
are working together on a so-called [Two-Mode
Hybrid](/wiki/Two-Mode_Hybrid "wikilink") system which is a full hybrid plus
additional efficiency improvements. The technology will be released in
2008 on the [Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid](/wiki/Chevrolet_Tahoe "wikilink"). The
system was also featured on the GMC Graphite SUV concept vehicle at the
2005 [North American International Auto
Show](/wiki/North_American_International_Auto_Show "wikilink") in
[Detroit](/wiki/Detroit "wikilink").[1]

The main difference to the Input-Split Hybrid is the addition of a
second planetary gearset, and the addition of two clutches (which can
actually operate as one). This enables the switching (two-modes) of the
percentage of mechanically vs. electrically transmitted power, and in
order to cope both with low- and high-speed regimes, only smaller
electrical motors with much less power and torque can be used. However,
no diagrams could be obtained so far explaining the 4 gear-ratios (and
why that would impose limits on the concurrent use of both electric
motors or not). Most likely, an additional, 3rd ravigneux-like planetary
gear with additional clutches is used for shifting between distinct
final gear ratios.

Types by degree of hybridization
--------------------------------

### Full hybrid

A **full hybrid**, sometimes also called a **strong hybrid**, is a
vehicle that can run on just the engine, just the batteries, or a
combination of both. The Prius and Escape Hybrids are examples of this,
as both cars can be moved forward on battery power alone. A large,
high-capacity battery pack is needed for battery-only operation. These
vehicles have a split power path that allows more flexibility in the
drivetrain by interconverting mechanical and electrical power, at some
cost in complexity. To balance the forces from each portion, the
vehicles use a [differential](differential_(mechanics) "wikilink")-style
linkage between the engine and motor connected to the head end of the
transmission.

The Toyota brand name for this technology is [Hybrid Synergy
Drive](/wiki/Hybrid_Synergy_Drive "wikilink"), which is being used in the
Prius, Highlander [sport-utility
vehicle](sport-utility_vehicle "wikilink") (SUV), and
[Camry](/wiki/Camry "wikilink"). A computer oversees operation of the entire
system, determining which half should be running, or if both should be
in use, shutting off the internal combustion engine when the electric
motor is sufficient to provide the power. The operation of the Prius can
be divided into five (5) distinct regimes:

1.  Electric vehicle mode
2.  Cruise mode
3.  Battery charge mode
4.  Power boost mode
5.  Negative split mode

In (1), the engine is off, and the battery provides electrical energy to
power the motor (or the reverse when regenerative breaking is engaged).
Used for idling as well when the battery [ state-of-charge
\[SOC](/wiki/SOC "wikilink")\] is high. In (2), the vehicle is cruising (i.e.
not accelerating), and the engine can meet the road load demand. The
power from the engine is split between the mechanical path and the
generator. The latter provides electrical energy to power the motor,
whose power is summed mechanically with the engine. If the battery
[SOC](/wiki/SOC "wikilink") is low, part of the power from the generator is
directed towards charging the battery. Regime (3) is used for idling as
well, except that in this case the battery [SOC](/wiki/SOC "wikilink") is low
and requires charging, which is provided by the engine and generator.
Regime (4) consists of situations where the engine cannot meet the road
load demand, and the battery is then used to power the motor to provide
a boost to the engine power. Finally, in (5) the vehicle is cruising and
the battery [SOC](/wiki/SOC "wikilink") is high. The battery provides power to
both the motor (to provide mechanical power) and to the generator. The
generator converts this to mechanical energy that it directs towards the
engine shaft, slowing it down (although not altering its torque output).
The purpose of this engine "lugging" is to increase the fuel economy of
the vehicle.

The hybrid drivetrain of the Prius, in combination with
[aerodynamics](aerodynamics "wikilink") and optimizations in the engine
itself to reduce drag, results in 80%–100% gains in fuel economy
compared to four-door conventional cars of similar weight and size.

### Power assist hybrid

<img src="2006_Mercury_Mariner_Hybrid_engine.jpg" title="fig:Engine compartment of a 2006 Mercury Mariner Hybrid" alt="Engine compartment of a 2006 Mercury Mariner Hybrid" width="250" />
**Power assist hybrids** use the engine for primary power, with a
torque-boosting electric motor also connected to a largely conventional
powertrain. The electric motor, mounted between the engine and
transmission, is essentially a very large starter motor, which operates
not only when the engine needs to be turned over, but also when the
driver "steps on the gas" and requires extra power. The electric motor
may also be used to re-start the combustion engine, deriving the same
benefits from shutting down the main engine at idle, while the enhanced
battery system is used to power accessories.

Honda's hybrids including the Insight use this design, leveraging their
reputation for design of small, efficient gasoline engines; their system
is dubbed [Integrated Motor Assist](/wiki/Integrated_Motor_Assist "wikilink")
(IMA). Assist hybrids differ fundamentally from full hybrids in that
they cannot run on electric power alone. However, since the amount of
electrical power needed is much smaller, the size of the battery systems
is reduced. Starting with the 2006 Civic Hybrid, the IMA system now can
propel the vehicle solely on electric power during medium speed
cruising.

A variation on this type of hybrid is the [Saturn VUE Green
Line](/wiki/Saturn_VUE#Green_Line "wikilink") hybrid system that uses a
smaller electric motor (mounted to the side of the engine), and battery
pack than the Honda IMA, but functions similarly.

Another variation on this type is [Mazda](/wiki/Mazda "wikilink")'s
[e-4WD](e-4WD "wikilink") system, offered on the [Mazda
Demio](/wiki/Mazda_Demio "wikilink") sold in Japan. This [front-wheel
drive](front-wheel_drive "wikilink") vehicle has an electric motor which
can drive the rear wheels when extra
[traction](traction_(engineering) "wikilink") is needed. The system is
entirely disengaged in all other driving conditions, so it does not
enhance performance or economy.

Ford has dubbed Honda's hybrids "mild" in their advertising for the
Escape Hybrid, arguing that the Escape's full hybrid design is more
efficient. However, assist hybrids should not be confused with actual
[mild hybrids](#Mild_hybrid "wikilink") like the Chevrolet Silverado
Hybrid. The term *mild hybrid* is not standardized, and its use is often
more inspired by [marketing](marketing "wikilink") than by technical
considerations.

### Mild hybrid

<img src="2006_GMC_Sierra_Hybrid_engine.jpg" title="fig:Engine compartment of a 2006 GMC Sierra Hybrid" alt="Engine compartment of a 2006 GMC Sierra Hybrid" width="250" />
**Mild hybrids** are essentially conventional vehicles with oversized
starter motors, allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the car is
coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly and cleanly.
Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the engine is
off, and as in other hybrid designs, the motor is used for regenerative
braking to recapture energy. The larger motor is used to spin up the
engine to operating rpm speeds before injecting any fuel.

Many people do not consider these to be hybrids at all, and these
vehicles do not achieve the fuel economy of full hybrid models. A major
example is the 2005 [Chevrolet Silverado
Hybrid](/wiki/Chevrolet_Silverado_Hybrid "wikilink"), a full-size [pickup
truck](pickup_truck "wikilink"). Chevrolet was able to get a 10%
improvement on the Silverado's fuel efficiency by shutting down and
restarting the engine on demand. Mild hybrids often use 42 volt systems
to supply the power needed for the startup motor, as well as to
compensate for the increasing number of electronic accessories on modern
vehicles.

[General Motors](/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation "wikilink") followed the
pickup truck hybrid with their [Belt alternator
starter](/wiki/Belt_alternator_starter "wikilink") (BAS) hybrid system, used
in the 2007 [Saturn VUE Green Line](/wiki/Saturn_VUE "wikilink"). For its
"start-stop" functionality, it operates similarly to the system in the
Silverado. But the GM BAS has broader hybrid functionality as the
electric motor can also provide modest assist under acceleration and
during steady driving, and captures regenerative braking, resulting in a
20% improvement in fuel efficiency; thus, the BAS can also be considered
an [Assist hybrid](hybrid_cars "wikilink").

### Plug-in hybrid

<figure>
<img src="New_Vehicle_Purchase_Preference.gif" title="The number of US survey respondents willing to pay $4,000 more for a plug-in hybrid car increased from 17% in 2005 to 26% in 2006." alt="The number of US survey respondents willing to pay $4,000 more for a plug-in hybrid car increased from 17% in 2005 to 26% in 2006." width="300" /><figcaption>The number of US survey respondents willing to pay $4,000 more for a <a href="Plug-in_hybrid_electric_vehicle" title="wikilink">plug-in hybrid</a> car increased from 17% in 2005 to 26% in 2006.</figcaption>
</figure>A **[plug-in hybrid electric
vehicle](plug-in_hybrid_electric_vehicle "wikilink")** (**PHEV**) is a
full hybrid, able to run in electric-only mode, with larger batteries
and the ability to recharge from the [electric power
grid](/wiki/Electric_power_transmission "wikilink"). They are also called
**gas-optional**, or **griddable hybrids**. Their main benefit is that
they can be gasoline-independent for daily commuting, but also have the
extended range of a hybrid for long trips. They can also be multi-fuel,
with the electric power supplemented by [diesel](diesel "wikilink"),
[biodiesel](biodiesel "wikilink"), or [hydrogen](hydrogen "wikilink").
The Electric Power Research Institute's research indicates a lower total
cost of ownership for PHEVs due to reduced service costs and gradually
improving batteries. The "[well-to-wheel](well-to-wheel "wikilink")"
efficiency and emissions of PHEVs compared to gasoline hybrids depends
on the energy sources of the grid (the US grid is 50%
[coal](coal "wikilink"); California's grid is primarily [natural
gas](natural_gas "wikilink"), [hydroelectric
power](hydroelectric_power "wikilink"), and [wind
power](wind_power "wikilink")). Particular interest in PHEVs is in
California where a "million solar homes" initiative is under way, and
global warming legislation has been enacted.

[Prototypes](/wiki/Prototype "wikilink") of PHEVs, with larger battery packs
that can be recharged from the power grid, have been built in the U.S.,
notably at Prof. [Andy Frank](/wiki/Andrew_A._Frank "wikilink")'s Hybrid
Center[2] at [UC Davis](/wiki/UC_Davis "wikilink") and one production PHEV,
the [Renault Kangoo](/wiki/Renault_Kangoo "wikilink"), went on sale in France
in 2003. [DaimlerChrysler](/wiki/DaimlerChrysler "wikilink") is currently
building PHEVs based on the [Mercedes-Benz
Sprinter](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Sprinter "wikilink") [van](van "wikilink").
Light Trucks are also offered by Micro-Vett SPA[3] the so called Daily
Bimodale.

The California Cars Initiative has converted the '04 and newer Toyota
Prius to become a prototype of what it calls the PRIUS+. With the
addition of 300 lb of [lead-acid
batteries](lead-acid_batteries "wikilink"), the PRIUS+ achieves roughly
double the gasoline [mileage](mileage "wikilink") of a standard Prius
and can make trips of up to 10 miles using only electric power.[4] Plug
-in Hybrid are like Series Hybrids.

Some scientists believe that PHEVs will soon become standard[5] in the
automobile industry.

Types by nature of the power source
-----------------------------------

### Electric-internal combustion hybrid

There are many ways to create an electric-internal combustion hybrid.
The variety of electric-ICE designs can be differentiated by how the
electric and combustion portions of the powertrain connect, at what
times each portion is in operation, and what percent of the power is
provided by each hybrid component. Two major categories are **series
hybrids** and **parallel hybrids**, though **parallel designs** are most
common today.

Most hybrids, no matter the specific type, use [regenerative
braking](regenerative_braking "wikilink") to recover energy when slowing
down the vehicle. This simply involves driving a motor so it acts as a
generator.

Many designs also shut off the internal combustion engine when it is not
needed in order to save energy. That concept is not unique to hybrids;
[Subaru](/wiki/Subaru "wikilink") pioneered this feature in the early 1980s,
and the [Volkswagen Lupo 3L](/wiki/VW_Lupo "wikilink") is one example of a
conventional vehicle that shuts off its engine when at a stop. Some
provision must be made, however, for accessories such as [air
conditioning](air_conditioning "wikilink") which are normally driven by
the engine. Furthermore, the lubrication systems of internal combustion
engines are inherently least effective immediately after the engine
starts; since it is upon startup that the majority of engine wear
occurs, the frequent starting and stopping of such systems reduce the
lifespan of the engine considerably. Also, start and stop cycles may
reduce the engine's ability to operate at its optimum temperature, thus
reducing the engine's efficiency.

<figure>
<img src="Hybridfuelcell.png" title="Structure of a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle" alt="Structure of a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle" width="300" /><figcaption>Structure of a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle</figcaption>
</figure>### Fuel cell hybrid

[Fuel cell](/wiki/Fuel_cell "wikilink") vehicles are often fitted with a
battery or supercapacitor to deliver peak acceleration power and to
reduce the size and power constraints on the fuel cell (and thus its
cost); this is effectively also a series hybrid configuration.

### Hydraulic hybrid

A [hydraulic](hydraulics "wikilink") hybrid vehicle uses hydraulic and
mechanical components instead of electrical ones. A [variable
displacement pump](variable_displacement_pump "wikilink") replaces the
motor/generator, and a [hydraulic
accumulator](hydraulic_accumulator "wikilink") (which stores energy as
highly compressed nitrogen gas) replaces the batteries. The hydraulic
accumulator, which is essentially a pressure tank, is potentially
cheaper and more durable than batteries. Hydraulic hybrid technology was
originally developed by Volvo Flygmotor and was used experimentally in
buses from the early 1980s and is still an active area.

Initial concept involved a giant [flywheel](flywheel "wikilink") (see
[Gyrobus](/wiki/Gyrobus "wikilink")) for storage connected to a hydrostatic
transmission, but it was later changed to a simpler system using a
hydraulic accumulator connected to a hydraulic pump/motor. It is also
being actively developed by [Eaton](/wiki/Eaton_Corporation "wikilink") and
several other companies, primarily in heavy vehicles like buses, trucks
and military vehicles. An example is the Ford F-350 Mighty Tonka concept
truck shown in 2002. It features an Eaton system that can accelerate the
truck up to highway speeds.

### Pneumatic hybrid

Compressed air can also power a hybrid car with a gasoline compressor to
provide the power. [Moteur Developpement
International](/wiki/Moteur_Developpement_International "wikilink") in France
produces such air cars. A team led by Tsu-Chin Tsao, a
[UCLA](/wiki/UCLA "wikilink") mechanical and aerospace engineering professor,
is collaborating with engineers from Ford to get Pneumatic hybrid
technology up and running. The system is similar to that of a
hybrid-electric vehicle in that braking energy is harnessed and stored
to assist the engine as needed during acceleration.

### Human power and environmental power hybrids

Many land and water vehicles use human power combined with a further
power source. Common are parallel hybrids, e.g. a boat being rowed and
also having a sail set, or [motorized
bicycles](motorized_bicycle "wikilink"). Also some series hybrids exist,
see in [hybrid vehicle](hybrid_vehicle "wikilink"). Such vehicles can be
[tribrid vehicles](tribrid_vehicle "wikilink"), combining at the same
time three power sources e.g. from on-board solar cells, from
grid-charged batteries, and from pedals.

Hybrid vehicle operation modes
------------------------------

<img src="Hybrid_modes.gif" title="fig:Hybrid_modes.gif" alt="Hybrid_modes.gif" width="500" />
Hybrid vehicles can be used in different modes. The figure shows some
typical modes for a parallel hybrid configuration.
