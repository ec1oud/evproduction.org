**OScar** is the first attempt to design an entire car (nowadays, also
extended to other vechicles - [bus](bus "wikilink"),
[truck](truck "wikilink") and [motorcycle](motorcycle "wikilink")) using
[open source](open_source "wikilink") principles. The aim of the project
is mainly to produce [blueprints](blueprint "wikilink"), using
essentially open source [CAD](/wiki/CAD "wikilink"). The project is still far
from producing a real car, but the progress has been continuous for some
years.

The Goal of the project is not to produce a sophisticated car, but
rather a simple and functional basic one, which answer basic people's
transportation needs. A long term goal is also to introduce
[standardization](standardization "wikilink") in
[parts](auto_part "wikilink") manufacturing (very much in the open
source way) to use [economies of scale](economies_of_scale "wikilink").
This is a radical change from the car industry current practices and
[business model](business_model "wikilink"), where every manufacturer
has his own standards. This monopoly on brand specific parts often
constitutes an important part of the manufacturers' revenues.

Among the challenges this car will have to overcome, before reaching the
manufacturing phase, is conducting [crash tests](crash_test "wikilink")
and also abiding by very strict security legislation and
[pollution](pollution "wikilink") norms in the car industry. In this
way, has been proposed [low-carbon](low-carbon "wikilink") [alternative
propulsion](alternative_propulsion "wikilink") OScars
([hybrid](petroleum_electric_hybrid_vehicle "wikilink"), [hydrogen
vehicle](hydrogen_vehicle "wikilink") and
[electric](battery-electric_vehicle "wikilink") versions).
