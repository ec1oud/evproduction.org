The following area is intended to be an archive of information valuable
to the design and maintenance of EV's.

I would hope to get links to resources like existing designs for
battery balancers, charging algorithms, battery charger controllers.
Designs not necessarily for the Freedom EV, but of value to
the EV community in general.

The [[Enabling technologies]] section provides references
on general EV components such as
[[Batteries]],
[[Battery monitoring/management systems]] and
[[Data Communications]].
