The following area is intended to be an archive of information valuable
to the design and maintenance of EV's.

I would hope to get links to resources like existing designs for
battery balancers, charging algorithms, battery charger controllers.
Designs not necessarily for the Freedom EV, but of value to
the EV community in general.


== Battery care and Maintenance ==

[[Battery monitoring/management systems]]
Hawker put out a [http://aaron.boim.com/EV/EVhandbook4hawkerBatteries.pdf useful guide for the general care of lead acid batteries].

They also have some [http://aaron.boim.com/EV/Hawker_BatteryApplicationHandbook.pdf other battery guides].
Even information for the [http://aaron.boim.com/EV/Hawker_ChargingLead-Tin_Batteries.pdf charging of lead-tin batteries].

NREL published a paper on an [http://crow/~aaron/EV/InteruptChargingAlgorithm.pdf interrupt charging algorithm]
for lead-acid batteries.

== Data Communications ==

I don't know much about CAN.  I guess there are some barriers to use/entry
of this automotive data bus for home-build EVs.
Lee Hart has published his design for a data communication bus for use in EV's,
where there is a lot of noise, and great need for isolation.
Here is the [http://aaron.boim.com/EV/RS232toEVILbus.gif schematic for converting EViLBus to RS232].
