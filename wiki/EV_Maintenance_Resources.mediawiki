The following area is intended to be an archive of information valuable
to the design and maintenance of EV's.

I would hope to get links to resources like existing designs for
battery balancers, charging algorithms, battery charger controllers.
Designs not necessarily for the Freedom EV, but of value to
the EV community in general.


== Battery care and Maintenance ==
Hawker put out a [http://aaron.boim.com/EV/EVhandbook4hawkerBatteries.pdf useful guide for the general care of lead acid batteries].

They also have some [http://aaron.boim.com/EV/Hawker_BatteryApplicationHandbook.pdf other battery guides].
Even information for the [http://aaron.boim.com/EV/Hawker_ChargingLead-Tin_Batteries.pdf charging of lead-tin batteries].

NREL published a paper on an [http://crow/~aaron/EV/InteruptChargingAlgorithm.pdf interrupt charging algorithm]
for lead-acid batteries.

Lee Hart did a very complete battery balancer design some years ago.
I hope that he will edit this page to link to his "official" resources.
He has been free with the information in the past, so in the interest
of getting a "Lee Hart Balancer" section started in this Wiki, here
are some [http://aaron.boim.com/EV/LeeHartBalancer/ schematics for the Lee Hart Balancer].
