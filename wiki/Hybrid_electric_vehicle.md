A **hybrid electric vehicle** (HEV) is a [vehicle](vehicle "wikilink")
using an on-board [rechargeable energy storage
system](rechargeable_energy_storage_system "wikilink") (RESS) and a
fueled power source for vehicle
[propulsion](/wiki/Ground_propulsion "wikilink"). The different propulsion
power systems may have common subsystems or components.

A hybrid vehicle provides better [fuel
economy](/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles "wikilink") than a [conventional
vehicle](conventional_vehicle "wikilink"), because the engine is smaller
and may be run at various speeds, providing more efficiency. Other
techniques may be used to recover or reduce waste energy (such as
[regenerative braking](/wiki/Regenerative_brake "wikilink") and shutting down
the combustion engine).

The term *[hybrid](hybrid "wikilink")* when used in relation with cars
also has other uses. Before its modern meaning of hybrid propulsion, it
was used in the [United States](/wiki/United_States "wikilink") to mean a
vehicle of mixed national origin, generally a
[European](/wiki/Europe "wikilink") car fitted with American mechanical
components; this meaning has fallen out of use. In the [import
scene](import_scene "wikilink"), *hybrid* often described an [engine
swap](engine_swap "wikilink"). Some have also called [flexible-fuel
vehicles](flexible-fuel_vehicle "wikilink") *hybrids*, because they can
use a mixture of different fuels—typically gasoline and
[ethanol](ethanol "wikilink") [alcohol fuel](alcohol_fuel "wikilink").

Technology
----------

Hybrid electric vehicles most commonly use [internal
combustion](internal_combustion "wikilink") engines and [electric
batteries](electric_battery "wikilink") to power [electric
motors](electric_motor "wikilink"). Modern
[mass-produced](mass_production "wikilink") hybrids prolong the charge
on their batteries by capturing [kinetic
energy](kinetic_energy "wikilink") via [regenerative
braking](regenerative_braking "wikilink"). Many PEHVs shut down the
combustion engine at idle, and re-start the combustion engine when
needed. As well, when cruising or in other situations where just light
thrust is needed, ["full"
hybrids](/wiki/Hybrid_Vehicle_Drivetrains#Full_hybrid "wikilink") can use the
combustion engine to generate electricity by spinning an [electrical
generator](electrical_generator "wikilink") (often a second electric
motor[1]) to either recharge the battery or directly feed power to an
electric motor that drives the vehicle. This contrasts with
all-[electric cars](/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") which use
batteries charged by an external source such as the grid, or a [range
extending trailer](/wiki/Genset_trailer "wikilink"). Nearly all hybrids still
require gasoline or diesel as their sole [fuel](fuel "wikilink") source
though other fuels such as [ethanol](ethanol "wikilink") or plant based
oils have also seen occasional use.

In 2007, several manufacturers have announced that future vehicles will
use aspects of hybrid technology to reduce fuel consumption without the
use of electric motors (the hybrid drivetrain) to drive the vehicle.
Regenerative braking can be used to recapture energy and stored to power
electrical accessories, such as air conditioning. Shutting down the
engine at idle can also be used to reduce fuel consumption and reduce
emissions without the addition of a hybrid drivetrain. In both cases,
some of the advantages of hybrid technology are gained while additional
cost and weight may be limited to the addition of larger batteries and
starter motors. There is no standard terminology for such vehicles,
although they may be termed [mild hybrids](mild_hybrid "wikilink").

History
-------

In 1898 [Ferdinand Porsche](/wiki/Ferdinand_Porsche "wikilink") designed the
Lohner-Porsche carriage, a series-hybrid vehicle that broke several
Austrian speed records, and also won the Exelberg Rally in 1901 with
Porsche himself driving. Over 300 of the Lohner-Porsche carriages were
sold to the public. As a series-hybrid, a gasoline engine powers a
generator, which powered electric wheel motors. A large and heavy
battery pack acted as an intermediate load-leveling device.

The 1915 Dual Power made by the [Woods Motor
Vehicle](/wiki/Woods_Motor_Vehicle "wikilink") electric car maker had a four
cylinder internal combustion engine and an electric motor. Below 15 mph
(25 km/h) the electric motor alone drove the vehicle, drawing power from
a battery pack, and above this speed the "main" engine cut in to take
the car up to its 35 mph (55 km/h) top speed. About 600 were made up to
1918. [2]

There have also been [air engine](air_engine "wikilink") hybrids where a
small petrol engine powered a compressor. Several types of air engines
also increased the range between fill-ups with up to 60% by absorbing
ambient heat from its surroundings.[3]

In 1959 the development of the first transistor-based electric car—the
[Henney Kilowatt](/wiki/Henney_Kilowatt "wikilink")—heralded the development
of the electronic speed control that paved the way for modern hybrid
electric cars. The Henney Kilowatt was the first modern production
electric vehicle and was developed by a cooperative effort between
National Union Electric Company, Henney Coachworks,
[Renault](/wiki/Renault "wikilink"), and the Eureka Williams Company. Although
sales of the Kilowatt were dismal, the development of the Kilowatt
served was a historical "who's who" of electric propulsion technology.

A more recent working prototype of the electric-hybrid vehicle was built
by [Victor Wouk](/wiki/Victor_Wouk "wikilink") (one of the scientists involved
with the Henney Kilowatt and also brother of author [Herman
Wouk](/wiki/Herman_Wouk "wikilink") ). Wouk's work with electric hybrid
vehicles in the 1960s and 1970s earned him the title as the "Godfather
of the Hybrid"[4]). Wouk installed a prototype electric-hybrid
drivetrain into a 1972 [Buick Skylark](/wiki/Buick_Skylark "wikilink")
provided by GM for the 1970 Federal Clean Car Incentive Program, but the
program was killed by the EPA in 1976 while Eric Stork, the head of the
EPA at the time, was accused of a prejudicial coverup[5]. Since then,
hobbyists have continued to build hybrids but none was put into mass
production by a major manufacturer until the waning years of the
twentieth century.

The regenerative-braking hybrid, the core design concept of most
production hybrids, was developed by Electrical Engineer David Arthurs
around 1978 using off-the shelf components and an [Opel
GT](/wiki/Opel_GT "wikilink"). However the voltage controller to link the
batteries, motor (a jet-engine starter motor), and DC generator was Mr.
Arthurs'. The vehicle exhibited \~75 mpg fuel efficiency and plans for
it (as well as somewhat updated versions) are still available through
the Mother Earth News web site. The Mother Earth News' own 1980 version
claimed nearly 84 mpg.

The [Bill Clinton](/wiki/Bill_Clinton "wikilink") administration initiated the
Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV)[6] program on
[September 29](/wiki/September_29 "wikilink") [1993](1993 "wikilink") that
involved Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, USCAR, the DoE, and other
various governmental agencies to engineer the next efficient and clean
vehicle. The NRC cited automakers’ moves to produce hybrid electric
vehicles as evidence that technologies developed under PNGV were being
rapidly adopted on production lines, as called for under Goal 2. Based
on information received from automakers, NRC reviewers questioned
whether the “Big Three” would be able to move from the concept phase to
cost effective, pre-production prototype vehicles by 2004, as set out in
Goal 3.[7]

The program was replaced by the hydrogen focused
[FreedomCAR](/wiki/FreedomCAR "wikilink") initiative[8] of George W. Bush's
administration in 2001. The focus of the FreedomCAR initiative being to
fund research too high risk for the private sector to engage in with the
long term goal of developing emission / petroleum free vehicles.

In the intervening period, the widest use of hybrid technology was
actually in [diesel-electric locomotives](/wiki/Diesel_locomotive "wikilink").
It is also used in diesel-electric [submarines](submarine "wikilink"),
which operate in essentially the same manner as hybrid electric cars.
However, in this case the goal was to allow operation underwater without
consuming large amounts of [oxygen](oxygen "wikilink"), rather than
economizing on fuel. Since then, many submarines have moved to [nuclear
power](nuclear_power "wikilink"), which can operate underwater
indefinitely, though a number of nations continue to rely on
diesel-electric fleets.

Automotive hybrid technology became successful in the 1990s when the
[Honda Insight](/wiki/Honda_Insight "wikilink") and [Toyota
Prius](/wiki/Toyota_Prius "wikilink") became available. These vehicles have a
direct linkage from the internal combustion engine to the driven wheels,
so the engine can provide acceleration power. The 2000s saw development
of [plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles](plug-in_hybrid_electric_vehicle "wikilink") (PHEVs), which can
be recharged from the [electrical power
grid](/wiki/Electric_power_transmission "wikilink") and do not require
conventional fuel for short trips. The [Renault
Kangoo](/wiki/Renault_Kangoo "wikilink") was the first production model of
this design, released in France in 2003. However, the environmental
benefits of plug-in hybrids depend somewhat on the source of the
electrical power. In particular, electricity generated with wind would
be cleaner than electricity generated with coal, the most polluting
source. On the other hand, electricity generated with coal in a central
power plant is still much cleaner than pure gasoline propulsion, due to
the much greater efficiencies of a central plant. Furthermore, coal is
only one source of centrally generated power, and in some places such as
California is only a minor contributor, overshadowed by natural gas and
other cleaner sources.

The Prius has been in high demand since its introduction. Newer designs
have more conventional appearance and are less expensive, often
appearing and performing identically to their non-hybrid counterparts
while delivering 40% better fuel efficiency. The [Honda Civic
Hybrid](/wiki/Honda_Civic_Hybrid "wikilink") appears identical to the
non-hybrid version, for instance, but delivers about 50
[US](/wiki/United_States "wikilink") [mpg](miles_per_gallon "wikilink") (4.7
[L](/wiki/Litre "wikilink")/100[km](kilometre "wikilink")). The redesigned
2004 Toyota Prius improved passenger room, cargo area, and power output,
while increasing energy efficiency and reducing emissions. The Honda
Insight, while not matching the demand of the Prius, stopped being
produced after 2006 and has a devoted base of owners. Honda has also
released a hybrid version of the [Accord](/wiki/Honda_Accord "wikilink").

2005 saw the first hybrid [sport utility
vehicle](sport_utility_vehicle "wikilink") (SUV) released, [Ford Motor
Company](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company "wikilink")'s [Ford Escape
Hybrid](/wiki/Ford_Escape_Hybrid "wikilink"). Toyota and Ford entered into a
licensing agreement in March 2004 allowing Ford to use 20 patents from
Toyota related to hybrid technology, although Ford's engine was
independently designed and built. In exchange for the hybrid licenses,
Ford licensed patents involving their European diesel engines to Toyota.
Toyota announced model year 2005 hybrid versions of the [Toyota
Highlander](/wiki/Toyota_Highlander "wikilink") and [Lexus RX
400h](/wiki/Lexus_RX_400h "wikilink") with 4WD-i which uses a rear electric
motor to power the rear wheels negating the need for a differential.
Toyota also plans to add hybrid drivetrains to every model it sells in
the coming decade.

For 2007 Lexus offers a hybrid version of their GS sport sedan dubbed
the GS450h with "well in excess of 300hp". The 2007 [Camry
Hybrid](/wiki/Toyota_Camry_Hybrid "wikilink") becomes available starting
Summer 2006 in USA and Canada. The initial batch of Camry Hybrids are
built in Japan; starting October 2006, Toyota Motor Manufacturing,
Kentucky (TMMK) will also produce these hybrids. Also,
[Nissan](/wiki/Nissan "wikilink") announced the release of the
[Altima](/wiki/Nissan_Altima "wikilink") hybrid (technology supplied by
Toyota) around 2007.

An [R.L. Polk](/wiki/R.L._Polk "wikilink") survey of 2003 model year cars
showed that hybrid car registrations in the [United
States](/wiki/United_States "wikilink") rose to 43,435 cars, a 25.8% increase
from 2002 numbers. [California](/wiki/California "wikilink"), the nation's
most populous state at one-eighth of the total population, had the most
hybrid cars registered: 11,425. The proportionally high number may be
partially due to the state's higher gasoline prices and stricter
emissions rules, which hybrids generally have little trouble passing.

Honda, which offers Insight, Civic and Accord hybrids, sold 26,773
hybrids in the first 11 months of 2004. Toyota has sold a cumulative
306,862 hybrids between 1997 and November 2004, and Honda has sold a
total of 81,867 hybrids between 1999 and November 2004.[9]

Hybrids currently available
---------------------------

### Automobiles and light trucks

A number of manufacturers currently produce hybrid automobiles and light
trucks, including [Ford](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company "wikilink"), [General
Motors](/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation "wikilink"),
[Honda](/wiki/Honda "wikilink"), [Mazda](Mazda "wikilink"),
[Nissan](/wiki/Nissan "wikilink"), [Peugeot](Peugeot "wikilink"),
[Renault](/wiki/Renault "wikilink") and [Toyota](Toyota "wikilink"). For a
list, see [List of hybrid vehicles](/wiki/List_of_hybrid_vehicles "wikilink").

**Microhybrid**s are small hybrid cars (see [city
car](city_car "wikilink")).

Combined sales of hybrids in the US rose 54% in February 2007 to more
than 22,998 units, up 52% from the results in February 2006. The figures
do not include sales of GM hybrids, which the automaker does not yet
break out, but do reflect the addition of the [Nissan Altima
Hybrid](/wiki/Nissan_Altima_Hybrid "wikilink"), now sold in eight states. [10]

</figure>### Locomotives

In May 2003 [JR East](/wiki/JR_East "wikilink") started test runs with the so
called NE (new energy) train and validated the system's functionality
(series hybrid with [lithium ion
battery](lithium_ion_battery "wikilink")) in cold regions. In 2004,
[RailPower Technologies](/wiki/RailPower_Technologies "wikilink") had been
running pilots in the US with the so called Green Goats which led to
orders by the [Union Pacific](/wiki/Union_Pacific "wikilink") and [Canadian
Pacific](/wiki/Canadian_Pacific "wikilink") Railways starting in early
2005[1](http://www.wired.com/news/planet/0,2782,66998,00.html),
[2](http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/Media/News/General/2005/Hybrid+locomotives.htm),[3](http://www.uprr.com/newsinfo/railroad/2005/0406_hybrid.shtml)

Railpower[11] offers hybrid road [switchers](switcher "wikilink"), as
does GE.[12] [Diesel-electric](/wiki/Diesel-electric "wikilink") locomotives
may not always be considered hybrids, not having energy storage on
board, unless they are fed with electricity via a collector for short
distances (for example, in tunnels with emission limits), in which case
they are better classified as [dual-mode
vehicles](dual-mode_vehicle "wikilink").

### Buses

In the United Kingdom, a local manufacturer has introduced a development
of the London 'Double-Decker', a new interpretation of the traditional
red buses that are a feature of the extreme traffic density in London.
These buses use a small diesel engine with electric storage through a
lithium ion battery pack. The use of a 1.9 litre diesel instead of the
typical 7.0 litre engine in a traditional bus demonstrates the possible
advantages of serial hybrids in extremely traffic-dense environments.

The use of a battery pack allows a much smaller installed IC-power
output, because the smaller power unit better reflects the *average
power requirement* in a city environment. The battery pack and
relatively high power electric motors provide the required power peaks
for acceleration, and the high installed power of the motors is
reflected by a high potental for brake-energy recovery.

This characteristic offers many potential advantages for bus services.
The smaller engine helps compensate for the additional package space and
weight requirements of an energy store (here the lithium ion batteries).
The solely electric drive to the axles avoids the need for complex
gearboxes and regulatory software & its development that parallel
hybrids such as [Prius](/wiki/Prius "wikilink") require. The high electric
installed power allows for an equivalently high energy recovery.
(Automotive hybrids that use small electric motors parallel to IC
engines can only recover a small proprtion of the available kinetic
energy. The remainder is lost as heat in the service brakes as with a
conventional non hybrid vehicle).

Based on a London test cycle, a reduction in CO2 emissions of 31% and
fuel savings in the range of 40% have been demonstrated, compared with a
modern 'Euro-4' compliant bus.[Wrightbus](/wiki/Wrightbus "wikilink")
[4](http://www.wright-bus.com)

These savings make the use of similar hybrid concepts in urban
environments increasingly likely and attractive to users such as refuse
collection, delivery & courier services. The scale of the possible
saving is such that even lead-acid energy storage is viable, depending
on the target of the customer. Here, the final choice of system depends
on the required compromise of available space in the vehicle; passenger
density, purchase price, route mix, for example urban extra-urban mix;
and of course legislative framework. Are emissions being taxed (CO2
minimised, NOx etc.)? Or is fuel heavily taxed (Europe vs. USA)? Here
different technical solutions may be favoured according to the local
legislation. (See also separate entries)

Also in 2005 GE introduced its hybrid [shifters](shifter "wikilink") on
the market. Toyota claims to have started with the Coaster Hybrid Bus in
1997 on the Japanese market. In May 2003 GM started to tour with hybrid
buses developed together with Allison. Several hundreds of those buses
have entered into daily operation in the US. The Blue Ribbon City Hybrid
bus was presented by [Hino](/wiki/Hino "wikilink"), a Toyota affiliate, in
January 2005.

[New Flyer](/wiki/New_Flyer "wikilink") and [Gillig](/wiki/Gillig "wikilink")
produce hybrid [buses](/wiki/Bus "wikilink") using either [ISE Corporation
ThunderVolt](http://www.isecorp.com) or [Allison](/wiki/Allison "wikilink")'s
electric drive system. The [Whispering
Wheel](/wiki/Whispering_Wheel "wikilink") bus is another hybrid.

### Trucks

In 2003 GM introduced a diesel hybrid military (light) truck, equipped
with a diesel electric and a fuel cell auxiliary power unit. Hybrid
light trucks were introduced 2004 by Mercedes (Hybrid Sprinter) and
Micro-Vett SPA (Daily Bimodale). International Truck and Engine Corp.
and Eaton Corp. have been selected to manufacture diesel-electric hybrid
trucks for a US pilot program serving the utility industry in 2004. In
mid 2005 [Isuzu](/wiki/Isuzu "wikilink") introduced the Elf Diesel Hybrid
Truck on the Japanese Market. They claim that approximately 300
vehicles, mostly route buses are using Hinos HIMR (Hybrid Inverter
Controlled Motor & Retarder) system.

A promising but as-yet unseen application for hybrid vehicle technology
would be in [garbage trucks](garbage_truck "wikilink"), since these
vehicles do stop-start driving and often stand
[idling](wikt:idling "wikilink").

Petroleum electric hybrid truck makers: [DAF
Trucks](/wiki/DAF_Trucks "wikilink"), [MAN AG](MAN_AG "wikilink") with [MAN
TGL Series](/wiki/MAN_TGL_Series "wikilink"), [Nissan
Motors](/wiki/Nissan_Motors "wikilink"), [Renault
Puncher](/wiki/Renault_Puncher "wikilink") with [Renault
Puncher](/wiki/Renault_Puncher "wikilink").

Hybrid technology: [ZF Friedrichshafen](/wiki/ZF_Friedrichshafen "wikilink").

### Military vehicles

The [United States Army](/wiki/United_States_Army "wikilink")'s manned ground
vehicles of the [Future Combat System](/wiki/Future_Combat_System "wikilink")
all use a hybrid electric drive consisting of a diesel engine to
generate electrical power for mobility and all other vehicle subsystems.

### Taxicabs

Hybrid technology may be particularly appropriate for use as
[taxicabs](taxicab "wikilink"), as in many locations they are used in
predominantly urban environments; have intensive operating schedules,
maximizing fuel savings over the life of the vehicle; and may spend
considerable periods of time at idle, where the hybrid engine may allow
for the combustion engine to be shut off (while retaining use of
electrical accessories). Hybrid taxicabs are primarily based on
production passenger vehicles, with modifications (often aftermarket) to
meet specialized usage requirements and/or local regulations (security
features, for example). Since vehicles in taxicab service may operate
for 10-20 hours per day, the reduction in local pollution and noxious
emissions may be more significant than that achieved by hybrids in
private vehicle use.

In 2005, [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City "wikilink") added six [Ford
Escape Hybrids](/wiki/Ford_Escape_Hybrid "wikilink") to their taxi fleet and
city officials said the entire fleet of 13,000 vehicles could be
converted within five years.[13]

Hybrid Drivetrain Types
-----------------------

<img src="Hybridserie.png" title="fig:Series hybrid vehicle" alt="Series hybrid vehicle" width="256" />
<img src="Hybridpar.png" title="fig:Parallel hybrid vehicle" alt="Parallel hybrid vehicle" width="192" />
There are many ways to create an electric-internal combustion hybrid.
The variety of electric-ICE designs can be differentiated by the
structure of the powertrain, the degree of hybridization and the mode of
operation. The main categories are **series hybrids** and **parallel
hybrids**, with **combined hybrids** having common characteristics of
series and parallel designs.

Hybrids other than electric-internal combustion exist. For example,
hydraulic and pneumatic hybrids, where compressed fluids and compressed
air, respectively, are used for energy storage with [regenerative
braking](regenerative_braking "wikilink").

Engines and fuel sources
------------------------

### Gasoline

[Gasoline engines](/wiki/Gasoline_engine "wikilink") are used in most hybrid
designs, and will likely remain dominant for the foreseeable future.
While [petroleum](petroleum "wikilink")-derived gasoline is the primary
fuel, it is possible to mix in varying levels of ethanol created from
[renewable energy](renewable_energy "wikilink") sources. Like most
modern [ICE](/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine "wikilink")-powered vehicles,
hybrids can typically use up to about 15%
[bioethanol](bioethanol "wikilink"). Manufacturers may move to [flexible
fuel engines](flexible_fuel_engine "wikilink"), which would increase
allowable ratios, but no plans are in place at present.

### Diesel

One type of hybrid vehicle combination uses a [diesel
engine](diesel_engine "wikilink") for power generation. Diesels have
advantages when delivering constant power for long periods of time,
suffering less wear while operating at higher efficiency. The diesel
engine's high torque, combined with hybrid technology, may offer
substantially improved mileage. Most diesel vehicles can use 100% pure
[biofuels](biofuel "wikilink") ([biodiesel](biodiesel "wikilink")), so
they can use but do not need [petroleum](petroleum "wikilink") at all
for fuel (although mixes of biofuel and petroleum are more common, and
petroleum may be needed for [lubrication](lubrication "wikilink")). If
diesel-electric hybrids were in use, this benefit would likely also
apply. Diesel-electric hybrid drivetrains have begun to appear in
commercial vehicles (particularly buses); as of 2007, no light duty
diesel-electric hybrid passenger cars are currently available, although
prototypes exist. Peugeot is expected to produce a diesel-electric
hybrid version of its 308 in late 2008 for the European market.[14]

Diesel-electric hybrids with parallel drivetrains like the Prius may
have a substantial cost disadvantage to other options. Diesel engines
are generally more expensive than gasoline equivalents, due to the
demands for higher [compression](compression "wikilink") (although this
also makes diesels more durable). If this "diesel premium" is added to
any additional expense for the hybrid, the diesel-electric combination
may make the payback period for such vehicles even longer and less
feasible for many consumers. In addition, the higher torque of diesel
engines may obviate one of the advantages of the electric motors. As
with regular diesel engines, diesel-electric hybrids may be more
appropriate for high-mileage, intensive-use applications, such as buses,
trucks, and delivery vehicles, and less appropriate for passenger
vehicles. In addition, regular diesel vehicles may get similar mileage
to gasoline-electric hybrids, for a smaller premium, and the marginal
benefit of "hybridization" may not be viable.

Diesels are not widely used for passenger cars in the United States, as
US diesel fuel has long been considered very "dirty", with relatively
high levels of [sulfur](sulfur "wikilink") and other contaminants in
comparison to the [Eurodiesel](/wiki/Eurodiesel "wikilink") fuel in Europe,
where greater restrictions have been in place for many years. Despite
the dirtier fuel at the pump, the US has tough restrictions on
[exhaust](exhaust "wikilink"), and it has been difficult for car
manufacturers to meet emissions levels as higher sulfur levels are
damaging to [catalytic converters](catalytic_converters "wikilink") and
other emission control systems. However, [ultra-low sulfur
diesel](ultra-low_sulfur_diesel "wikilink") was mandated and became
widely available in the U.S. in October 2006 for highway vehicles, which
will allow the use of newer emissions control systems.

Diesel-electric motors are common for use as
[locomotives](locomotives "wikilink"), but using a serial hybrid design.
In locomotives, the diesel engine is used to generate electricity for
the electric drivetrain. This configuration allows the internal
combustion engine to be operated at more efficient operating parameters,
while removing the need for a separate transmission for the ICE unit and
allowing the efficient delivery of torque from the electric motors. Such
a system may need a smaller diesel engine and allow for better emissions
controls, since the operating range of the diesel engine would be
optimized for electric generation rather than power delivery through the
mechanical transmission and wheels. There have been studies of this type
of diesel-electric hybrid, but there are no confirmed attempts to
commercialize such a vehicle for passenger use.

[PSA Peugeot Citroën](/wiki/PSA_Peugeot_Citroën "wikilink") has unveiled two
demonstrator vehicles featuring a diesel-electric hybrid powertrain: the
[Peugeot 307](/wiki/Peugeot_307 "wikilink") and [Citroën
C4](/wiki/Citroën_C4 "wikilink") Hybride HDi
([PDF](http://www.psa-peugeot-citroen.com/document/presse_communique/CP_hybride_HDI_GB1138705079.pdf)).
VW made a [prototype](prototype "wikilink") diesel-electric hybrid car
that achieved 2 litres/100 km (118 mpg US) fuel economy, but has yet to
sell a hybrid vehicle. [General
Motors](/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation "wikilink") has been testing the
[Opel Astra](/wiki/Opel_Astra "wikilink") Diesel Hybrid. There have been no
concrete dates suggested for these vehicles, but press statements have
suggested production vehicles would not appear before 2009.

![Hybrid Orion VI
Metrobus\|300px](Hybrid-bus.jpg "fig:Hybrid Orion VI Metrobus|300px")So
far, production diesel-electric engines have mostly just appeared in
[mass transit](mass_transit "wikilink") buses. Current manufacturers of
diesel-electric hybrid buses include [New Flyer
Industries](/wiki/New_Flyer_Industries "wikilink"),
[Gillig](/wiki/Gillig "wikilink"), [Orion Bus
Industries](/wiki/Orion_Bus_Industries "wikilink"), and [North American Bus
Industries](/wiki/North_American_Bus_Industries "wikilink"). In
[2008](2008 "wikilink"), [NovaBus](/wiki/NovaBus "wikilink") will add a
diesel-electric hybrid option as well.

Benefits
--------

Benefits of the hybrid design include:

-   Current hybrid vehicles reduce petroleum consumption (compared to
    otherwise similar ICE vehicles) primarily by using three
    mechanisms: a) Reducing wasted energy during idle/low output,
    generally by turning the internal combustion engine off; b)
    Recapturing waste energy (i.e. regenerative braking); c) reducing
    the size and power of the ICE engine, and hence inefficiencies from
    under-utilization, by using the better torque response of electric
    motors to compensate for the loss in peak power output from the
    smaller internal combustion engine. Any combination of these three
    primary hybrid technologies may be used for different fuel usage,
    power, emissions, weight and cost profiles.
-   Hybrids may also make more aggressive use of other fuel-saving
    techniques, such as reduced weight; these are not advantages of the
    hybrid design, but engineering choices made for various reasons,
    including marketing to consumers conscious of these issues.
-   Trade-offs include higher weight for electric motors and batteries,
    which may reduce fuel efficiency at highway speeds compared to
    otherwise equivalent ICE vehicles, or even result in lower fuel
    efficiency at highway speeds than in urban use; for this reason,
    hybrids may be considered to be particularly well suited to urban
    applications.
-   The internal-combustion engine in a hybrid vehicle is smaller,
    lighter, and more efficient than the one in a conventional vehicle,
    because the combustion engine can be sized for slightly above
    *average* power demand rather than *peak* power demand. A standard
    combustion engine is required to operate over a range of speed and
    power, yet its highest efficiency is in a narrow range of
    operation—in a hybrid vehicle, the combustion engine operates within
    its range of highest efficiency. The power curve of electric motors
    is better suited to variable speeds and can provide substantially
    greater torque at low speeds compared with internal-combustion
    engines.
-   Like many electric cars, but in contrast to conventional vehicles,
    [braking](brake "wikilink") in a hybrid is controlled in part by the
    [electric motor](electric_motor "wikilink") which can recapture part
    of the [kinetic energy](kinetic_energy "wikilink") of the car to
    partially recharge the batteries. This is called [regenerative
    braking](regenerative_braking "wikilink") and contributes to the
    higher efficiency of hybrid cars. In a conventional vehicle, braking
    is done by mechanical brakes, and the kinetic energy of the car is
    wasted as [heat](heat "wikilink").
-   Hybrids' greater [fuel economy](fuel_economy "wikilink") has
    implication for reduced petroleum consumption and [vehicle air
    pollution emissions](roadway_air_dispersion_modeling "wikilink")
    worldwide[15]
-   Reduced wear on the gasoline engine, particularly from idling with
    no load.
-   Reduced wear on brakes from the regenerative braking system use.
-   Reduced noise emissions resulting from substantial use of electric
    motor at low speeds, leading to [roadway](roadway_noise "wikilink")
    [noise reduction](noise_mitigation "wikilink") and beneficial [noise
    health effects](noise_health_effects "wikilink"). Note, however,
    that this is not always an advantage; for example, people who are
    blind or visually-impaired, and who rely on vehicle-noise while
    crossing streets, find it more difficult to do safely.
-   Reduced [air pollution](air_pollution "wikilink") emissions due to
    lower fuel consumption, leading to improved human health with regard
    to [respiratory](respiratory "wikilink") and other illness.
    Composite driving tests indicate total air pollution of carbon
    monoxide and reactive hydrocarbons are 80 to 90 percent cleaner for
    hybrid versus conventional
    vehicles[5](http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/ap/down/Hybridreport.pdf).
    Pollution reduction in urban environments may be particularly
    significant due to elimination of idle-at-rest.
-   Increased driving range without refueling or recharging, compared
    with electric vehicles and perhaps even compared with
    internal-combustion vehicles. Limitations in range have been a
    problem for traditional electric vehicles. Hybrids may have
    substantially longer "operating hours" per unit of petroleum in
    certain conditions than the mileage-rated fuel efficiency figures
    may indicate, due to the reduction of idle-at-rest.

### Incentives for hybrids and taxes for traditional vehicles

In order to encourage the purchase of hybrid vehicles, several
incentives have been made into law:

#### North America

##### Canada

-   Residents in Ontario, Canada can claim a rebate on the Provincial
    Retail Sales Tax of up to $2,000 CDN on the purchase or lease of a
    hybrid vehicle. [16]
-   Residents in British Columbia are eligible for a 100% reduction of
    sales tax up to a maximum of $2,000 if the hybrid vehicle is
    purchased or leased before April 1, 2011 (extended in 2007/2008
    budget from March 31, 2008 and expanded from a maximum of only
    $1,000 from April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009, at which point the
    concession was scheduled to expire.) [17]
    [6](http://www.bcbudget.gov.bc.ca/2007/bfp/default.aspx?hash=8),
    Government of British Columbia, accessed March 22, 2007</ref>

##### United States

-   Starting *[January 1](/wiki/January_1 "wikilink"),
    [2006](2006 "wikilink")*, the purchase of hybrid cars qualifies for
    a tax credit up to $3400 on the purchaser's Federal income taxes.
    The [tax credit](tax_credit "wikilink") is to be phased out two
    calendar quarters after the manufacturer reaches 60,000 new cars
    sold in the following manner: it will be reduced to 50% ($1700) if
    delivered in either the third or fourth quarter after the threshold
    is reached, to 25% ($850) in the fifth and sixth quarters, and 0%
    thereafter.
-   Hybrid purchases *before [January 1](/wiki/January_1 "wikilink"),
    [2006](2006 "wikilink")* qualify for a tax deduction on the
    [IRS](/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service "wikilink") [1040
    form](form_1040 "wikilink"). In 2003 hybrid owners qualified for a
    $2,000 deduction; the deduction reduces by $500 each year until it
    reaches zero.
    [HR](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "wikilink") 1308 Sec.
    319 proposed the phasing out of the deduction to put on hold for the
    year 2004 and 2005; (i.e., hybrid car buyers can enjoy the $2,000
    deduction before the phasing-out resumes at $500 in 2006).
-   Many states give additional tax credits to hybrid car buyers
-   Certain states (e.g., [New York](/wiki/New_York "wikilink"),
    [California](/wiki/California "wikilink"),
    [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia "wikilink"), and [Florida](Florida "wikilink"))
    allow singly-occupied hybrid vehicles to enter the
    [HOV](/wiki/HOV "wikilink") lanes on the highway. Initially, the [Federal
    Highway Administration](/wiki/Federal_Highway_Administration "wikilink")
    ruled that this was a violation of federal statute[18] until [August
    10](/wiki/August_10 "wikilink") [2005](2005 "wikilink") when [George W.
    Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush "wikilink") signed the [Transportation Equity
    Act of
    2005](/wiki/Safe,_Accountable,_Flexible,_Efficient_Transportation_Equity_Act:_A_Legacy_for_Users "wikilink")
    into law.
-   Some states, e.g. [California](/wiki/California "wikilink"), exempt hybrid
    cars from the [biennial](biennial "wikilink")
    [smog](smog "wikilink") inspection, which costs over $50 ([as of
    2004](as_of_2004 "wikilink")).
-   Hybrid cars can go on certain toll roads for free.
-   The city of [San Jose, California](/wiki/San_Jose,_California "wikilink")
    issues a free parking tag for hybrid cars that were purchased at a
    San Jose dealership. The qualified owners do not have to pay for
    parking in any city garage or road side parking meters.
-   City of [Los Angeles,
    California](/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California "wikilink") offers free parking
    to all hybrid vehicles starting on [October 1](/wiki/October_1 "wikilink")
    [2004](2004 "wikilink"). The experiment is an extension to an
    existing offer of free parking for all pure electrical vehicles.
-   In October, 2005, the City of [Baltimore,
    Maryland](/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland "wikilink") started to offer discount
    on monthly parking in the city parking lots, and is considering free
    meter parking for hybrid vehicles. On [November
    3](/wiki/November_3 "wikilink") [2005](2005 "wikilink"), the *[Boston
    Globe](/wiki/Boston_Globe "wikilink")* reports that the city council of
    [Boston](/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts "wikilink") is considering the same
    treatment for hybrid cars.
-   Annual vehicle registration fees in the [District of
    Columbia](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "wikilink") are half ($36) that paid for
    conventionally vehicles ($72).
-   Other proposed ones [19]

#### European Union

##### Netherlands

The new [Vehicle Registration
Taxes](/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate "wikilink"), payable when a car is
sold to its first buyer, can earn the owner of a hybrid a discount up to
[€](€ "wikilink")6000.

##### Republic of Ireland

-   A 50% reduction in [Vehicle Registration
    Tax](/wiki/Vehicle_Registration_Tax "wikilink") (VRT) applies, which
    normally amounts to 25% of the market value of a car.

##### United Kingdom

-   Drivers of hybrid vehicles in the [United
    Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom "wikilink") benefit from the lowest band of
    vehicle excise duty (car tax) which is based on
    [CO<sub>2</sub>](carbon_dioxide "wikilink") emissions. In
    [London](/wiki/London "wikilink"), these vehicles are also exempt from the
    £8 ($14) daily [congestion
    charge](/wiki/London_congestion_charge "wikilink") in [central
    London](http://www.cclondon.com/exemptions.shtml). Due to their low
    levels of regulated emissions, the greenest cars are eligible for
    100% discount under the current system.

<!-- -->

-   To be eligible the car must be on the current [Power Shift
    Register](http://www.est.org.uk/uploads/documents/fleet/PowerShift%20Register%2020.02.07.pdf).
    At present, these include the cleanest
    [LPG](http://www.whatgreencar.com/lpg.php) and [natural
    gas](http://www.whatgreencar.com/cng.php) cars and most
    hybrid-electric, [battery electric
    vehicles](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") and [fuel
    cell-electric vehicles](/wiki/List_of_fuel_cell_vehicles "wikilink").

Trade-offs, comparisons and criticisms
--------------------------------------

### Expense

Hybrid vehicles are more expensive (the so-called "hybrid premium") than
traditional internal-combustion vehicles, due to extra batteries, more
electronics and in some cases other design considerations. The trade-off
between higher initial cost and lower fuel costs (often referred to as
the [payback period](payback_period "wikilink")) is dependent on usage -
miles traveled, or hours of operation, and fuel costs. Traditional
economy vehicles may result in a lower direct cost for many users
(before consideration of any [externality](externality "wikilink")).
[Consumer Reports](http://www.consumerreports.org/) ran an article in
April 2006 stating that hybrids would not pay for themselves over 5
years of ownership. However, this included an error[20] with charging
the "hybrid premium" twice. When corrected
[7](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/new-cars/high-cost-of-hybrid-vehicles-406/overview/index.htm),
the Honda Civic Hybrid and Toyota Prius did have a payback period of
slightly less than 5 years. This includes conservative estimates with
depreciation (seen as more depreciation than a non-hybrid, although that
is not the current norm) and with gas prices. In particular, the
Consumer Reports article assumed $2/gallon for 3 years, $3/gallon for
one year and $4/gallon the last year. As recent events have shown, this
is a volatile market and hard to predict. For 2006, gas prices ranged
from low $2 to low $3, averaging about $2.60/gallon.

A January 2007 analysis by Intellichoice.com shows that all 22 currently
available hybrids will save their owners money over a five year period.
The most savings is for the Toyota Prius, which has a five year cost of
ownership 40.3% lower than the cost of comparable non-hybrid
vehicles.[21]

Many hybrid owners have justified their purchase through other, more
traditional means. Most cars are not purchased solely on an economic
basis, as evidenced by the prevalence of automatic transmission, power
windows and air-conditioning, not to mention any new car vs. used,
luxury cars and even large SUVs owned by office workers. Instead, cars
that meet the owner's affordability range are considered, and the one
with the best set of features for that owner is selected. In this case,
the feature set includes lower contribution to global warming gases
(beyond that of simple fuel efficiency gains, for Toyota and some other
manufacturers), less pollution which is shown to cause and exacerbate
respiratory afflictions like asthma, sending a message to the
manufacturers that demand exists for a car that takes environmental
effects into consideration, and sending less money to oil-producing
countries (a large component of the U.S. trade deficit).

### Design considerations

In some cases, manufacturers are producing hybrid vehicles that use the
added energy provided by the hybrid systems to give vehicles a power
boost, rather than significantly improved fuel efficiency compared to
their traditional counterparts.[22] The trade-off between added
performance and improved fuel efficiency is partly controlled by the
software within the hybrid system and partly the result of engine,
battery and motor sizing. In the future, manufacturers may provide
hybrid-owners with the ability to partially control this balance (fuel
efficiency vs. added performance) as they wish, through a
user-controlled setting.[23] Toyota announced in January, 2006 that it
was considering a "high-efficiency" button.

### Hybrids vs. electric vehicles

Battery powered all-electric cars
([BEVs](/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink")) are more popular in Europe
than in the U.S. Most European electric vehicles are purchased from
manufacturers, while due to unavailability of manufactured vehicles,
most U.S. vehicles are owner-built
[conversions](/wiki/Electric_vehicle_conversion "wikilink") of older
conventional vehicles. The major U.S. automobile manufacturers argue
that customer demand for pure electric cars is small. In addition, the
long suburban commutes common in the U.S. make range an important
criterion for electric vehicle design. However, if advances in battery
technology allow increased range at comparable cost to gasoline-powered
vehicles, manufacturers will likely mass-market electric vehicles. The
relative cost of gasoline to an equivalent amount of electrical energy
will also be a critical factor in the electric vehicle market.

Another relevant factor is the ultimate source of power for the electric
vehicles. In areas where older coal-fired generators are the source of
electrical power, a pure electric vehicle will be responsible for more
of some types of pollution — namely sulfates and particulates — than a
hybrid vehicle, while less of other types of pollution, such as [carbon
monoxide](carbon_monoxide "wikilink") and [nitrogen
oxide](nitrogen_oxide "wikilink") emissions [(Table
1)](http://www.evadc.org/pwrplnt.pdf). Whether greenhouse gas emissions
will be lower in such a case is still under debate.
(See[8](http://www.calcars.org/vehicles.html#2) vs.
[9](http://www.ilea.org/lcas/taharaetal2001.html).) In any event, the
local pollution effects would be lessened by a fleet of electric cars,
because the sources of the pollution would be outside of urban areas.

A possible advantage of the hybrid vehicle is in not requiring any
upgrades to the [electric power
transmission](electric_power_transmission "wikilink") grid. Since it
can't be scaled larger and smaller at will, the grid is sized so as to
carry almost the maximum load (*i.e.* summer air conditioning) with only
occasional failures, and thus has much of its capacity idle most of the
time. For the electric utilities, it would be advantageous to utilize
that excess capacity and thereby generate a greater revenue for their
fixed investment, by selling power to consumers to recharge their
vehicles. However, this vision very pointedly does not allow for
recharging of vehicles during peak usage times; to do so would require
substantial upgrades to the capacity of the grid, and again leave the
utilities with excess capacity most of the time. On the other hand, to
require consumers to refrain from recharging their vehicles during
certain times may not be an easy idea to sell to them.

For now, car manufacturers are focusing on [fuel
cell](fuel_cell "wikilink")-based cars and hybrids. Fuel cell vehicles
are being developed in a long-term research environment, rather than
with expectations of production at any definite time. Toyota intends all
of its vehicles to have a hybrid option by 2012.

### Plug in

[After market](/wiki/Aftermarket_(automotive) "wikilink") [plug
in](plug_in "wikilink") [kits](kit_car "wikilink") are available for
some hybrids from [third party](third_party "wikilink")
[manufacturers](manufacturer "wikilink"). These greatly increase mileage
per unit of petroleum (although overall energy consumption may be the
same). Cost savings, toxic pollution and greenhouse gas production will
depend on the local electric regime. If electricity generation is
located elsewhere, it may reduce local emissions of toxins, an advantage
in urban areas. If electricity generation is localized to the charging
site using [solar panels](solar_panels "wikilink"), it may be possible
to reduce overall emissions. See [Plug-in hybrid electric
vehicle](/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid_electric_vehicle "wikilink") in general, and
[plug-ins for the
Prius](/wiki/Toyota_Prius#Better_batteries.2Fplug-ins "wikilink").

Core segment in the market
--------------------------

Hybrids are viewed by some [automakers](automaker "wikilink") as a core
segment of the future vehicle market .[24]
