[Johnson's Hot Rod Shop](http://johnsonshotrodshop.com/) has steering
columns, rack & pinion, etc. from several different brands, including
[Flaming River](http://www.flaming-river.com/price-list.htm), who also
makes [micro steering columns](http://www.flamingriver.com/micro.htm).
But that stuff is overpriced.
