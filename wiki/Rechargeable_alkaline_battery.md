**Rechargeable alkaline battery** is a type of [alkaline
battery](alkaline_battery "wikilink") that is
[rechargeable](rechargeable "wikilink"). The shapes include
[AAA](/wiki/AAA_battery "wikilink"), [AA battery](AA_battery "wikilink"), C, D
and snap-on 9-volt batteries. People who use small-sized or portable
devices powered on batteries often will use these type of batteries.
[Rayovac](/wiki/Rayovac "wikilink") produced a variety of rechargeable
batteries called Renewal. They required a special charger which could
only charge this type of battery. Rayovac discontinued these products,
but other rechargeable alkaline batteries are still available from other
vendors, as well as other types of rechargeable batteries in the
alkaline battery form factor. Some types of battery chargers are able to
recharge these batteries as well as [NiCd](/wiki/NiCd "wikilink") and
[NiMH](/wiki/NiMH "wikilink"), provided that the charger only has one type in
it at any one time.

Some claim that it is indeed possible to recharge a regular
non-rechargeable alkaline battery under the right conditions and using
the right type of current; however, this is not recommended due to risk
of explosion and leakage. There is a charger available called the
Battery Xtender[1](http://www.batteryxtender.com/), which is specially
designed to recharge ordinary alkaline batteries, in addition to NiCd
and NiMH. Under ideal conditions it's supposed to recharge regular
alkalines up to 10 or 15 times, though in practice five recharges is
more common (after which they start to leak).
