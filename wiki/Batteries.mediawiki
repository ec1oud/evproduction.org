Batteries in Open source electric vehicles are based on  the '''Open Source Battery Project'''. 

It is at least possible for EV/Hybrid batteries to be built for significantly less than the current models are selling for. All that's missing is a good solid 'Open Source' design.

To this end, appeared a new group to attempt to design just such a system, for building batteries for much less than they are being sold. 
 
At the very least you will have the opportunity to understand the battery and battery managements systems better than ever.
