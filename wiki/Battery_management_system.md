A **battery regulator** is a device in a [battery
pack](battery_pack "wikilink") which bleeds off excess charge current to
allow all cells or batteries in a string to be fully charged without
overcharging other cells. Since they may all reach full charge at
different times because of differences in capacity due to age, a
regulator keeps all the batteries or cells in balance. They are most
effective during periodic full charge events performed to PbA battery
packs by holding down the finishing voltage preventing weak cells from
overcharging and gassing. Regulators do not actively balance batteries
by shuttling power during operation like a [battery
balancer](battery_balancer "wikilink") does, a balancer may further
extend a packs lifespan.

Regulators are most often used in
[BEV](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") battery packs to prolong the
packs' useful lifespan.
