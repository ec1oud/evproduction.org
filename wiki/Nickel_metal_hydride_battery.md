A **nickel metal hydride battery**, abbreviated **NiMH**, is a type of
[rechargeable battery](rechargeable_battery "wikilink") similar to a
[nickel-cadmium](nickel-cadmium_battery "wikilink")
([Ni](/wiki/Nickel "wikilink")[Cd](Cadmium "wikilink")) battery but has a
hydrogen-absorbing [alloy](alloy "wikilink") for the
[anode](anode "wikilink") instead of [cadmium](cadmium "wikilink"). Like
in NiCd batteries, [nickel](nickel "wikilink") is the
[cathode](cathode "wikilink"). A NiMH battery can have two to three
times the capacity of an equivalent size NiCd and the [memory
effect](memory_effect "wikilink") is not as significant. However,
compared to the [lithium-ion battery](lithium-ion_battery "wikilink"),
the [volumetric](volumetric "wikilink") [energy
density](energy_density "wikilink") is lower and self-discharge is
higher.

Applications of NiMH type batteries includes [hybrid
vehicles](hybrid_vehicle "wikilink") such as the
[Toyota](/wiki/Toyota "wikilink") [Prius](Prius "wikilink") and consumer
electronics. The NiMH technology will also be used on the
[Alstom](/wiki/Alstom "wikilink") [Citadis](Citadis "wikilink") [low
floor](low_floor "wikilink") [tram](tram "wikilink") ordered for
[Nice](/wiki/Nice "wikilink"), [France](France "wikilink"); as well as the
humanoid prototype robot [ASIMO](/wiki/ASIMO "wikilink") designed by
[Honda](/wiki/Honda "wikilink"). Standard NiMH batteries perform better with
moderate drain devices such as [digital
cameras](digital_camera "wikilink"),
[flashlights](flashlight "wikilink"), and other consumer electronics.
Because NiCd batteries have lower [internal
resistance](internal_resistance "wikilink"), they still have the edge in
very high current drain applications such as cordless [power
tools](power_tool "wikilink") and [RC cars](/wiki/RC_car "wikilink").

Charging
--------

<figure>
<img src="Charge_NiMH.svg" title="NIMH Charge curve" alt="NIMH Charge curve" width="400" /><figcaption>NIMH Charge curve</figcaption>
</figure>The charging voltage is 1.4-1.6
V/cell.[1](http://www.duracell.com/oem/rechargeable/Nickel/methods.asp)
Duracell recommends "a maintenance charge of indefinite duration at
C/300 rate". A fully charged cell measures 1.35-1.4 V (unloaded), and
supplies a nominal average 1.2V during discharge, down to about 1.0V
(further discharge may cause permanent damage). Voltage Depression
("Memory Effect") from repeated partial discharge can occur, but is
reversible through charge cycling.
[2](http://www.duracell.com/oem/rechargeable/Nickel/voltdep.asp)

When fast-charging, it is advisable to charge the NiMH batteries with a
smart [battery charger](battery_charger "wikilink") to avoid
overcharging, which can damage batteries and cause dangerous conditions.
Modern NiMH batteries contain [catalysts](catalyst "wikilink") to
immediately deal with gases developed as a result of over-charging
without being harmed (2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> ---catalyst--&gt;
2 H<sub>2</sub>O). However, this only works with over-charging
[currents](/wiki/Current_(electricity) "wikilink") of up to *C*/10 h (nominal
capacity divided by 10 hours). As a result of this reaction, the
batteries will heat up considerably, marking the end of the charging
process. Some quick chargers have a fan to keep the batteries cool.

Some equipment manufacturers consider that NiMH can be safely charged in
simple fixed (low) current chargers with or without timers, and that
permanent over-charging is permissible with currents up to *C*/10 h. In
fact, this is what happens in cheap cordless phone base stations and the
cheapest battery chargers. Although this may be safe, it may not be good
for the health of the battery. According to the
[Panasonic](/wiki/Panasonic "wikilink") NiMH charging manual (link below),
permanent trickle charging (small current overcharging) can cause
battery deterioration and the trickle charge rate should be limited to
between 0.033×*C* per hour and 0.05×*C* per hour for a maximum of 20
hours to avoid damaging the batteries.

Long-term maintenance charge of NiMH batteries needs to be by low [duty
cycle](duty_cycle "wikilink") pulses of high current rather than
continuous low current in order to preserve battery health.

Brand new batteries, or batteries which have been unused for some time,
need "reforming" to reach their full capacity. For this reason new
batteries may need several charge/discharge cycles before they operate
to their advertised capacity.

Discharging
-----------

Care must also be taken during discharge to ensure that one or more
cells in a series-connected battery pack, like the common arrangement of
four [AA](/wiki/AA_battery "wikilink") cells in series in a [digital
camera](digital_camera "wikilink"), do not become completely discharged
and go into [polarity reversal](/wiki/Reverse_charging "wikilink"). Cells are
never absolutely identical, and inevitably one will be completely
discharged before the others. When this happens, the "good" cells will
start to "drive" the discharged cell in reverse, which can cause
permanent damage to that cell. Some cameras, [GPS
receivers](/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "wikilink") and
[PDAs](/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant "wikilink") detect the safe
end-of-discharge voltage of the series cells and shut themselves down,
but devices like flashlights and some toys do not. Once noticeable
dimming or slowing of the device is noticed, it should be turned off
immediately to avoid polarity reversal. A single cell driving a load
won't suffer from polarity reversal, because there are no other cells to
reverse-charge it when it becomes discharged.

NiMH chemistry has a somewhat higher self-discharge rate than the NiCd
chemistry. The self-discharge is 5-10% on the first day, and stabilizes
around 0.5-1% per day at [room
temperature](room_temperature "wikilink"). The rate is strongly affected
by the temperature at which the batteries are stored with cooler storage
temperatures leading to slower discharge rate and longer battery life.
The highest capacity cells on the market (&gt; 2300mAh) are reported to
have the highest discharge rates.

### Low Self Discharge Batteries

A new type of nickel metal hydride battery was introduced in 2006 that
claims to reduce self discharge, and therefore lengthen shelf life. By
using a new separator, manufacturers claim between 70 to 85% of capacity
is retained after one year, when stored at 20 degrees Celsius (68F).
These cells are marketed as "ready to use" rechargeables, and are
targeted towards typical consumers who use their digital cameras only a
few times a year. Besides the longer shelf life, they are otherwise
similar to normal NiMH batteries of equivalent capacity, and can be
charged in typical NiMH chargers. Some brands that are currently
available on the market (May 2007) are [Accupower](/wiki/Accupower "wikilink")
Acculoop, [Ansmann](/wiki/Ansmann "wikilink") MaxE range, [Gold
Peak](/wiki/Gold_Peak "wikilink") [ReCyko](ReCyko "wikilink"),
[Kodak](/wiki/Kodak "wikilink") Pre Charged, [Nexcell](Nexcell "wikilink")
EnergyOn, [Panasonic R2](/wiki/Panasonic_R2 "wikilink"),
[Rayovac](/wiki/Rayovac "wikilink") Hybrid, [Sanyo](Sanyo "wikilink")
[Eneloop](/wiki/Eneloop "wikilink"), Titanium Power Enduro,
[Uniross](/wiki/Uniross "wikilink") Hybrio, and [VARTA](VARTA "wikilink")
Ready2use. These appear to be available in AA and AAA sizes only, and
have less capacity (2000\~2100mAh in AA) than the current generation of
high capacity cells (2800mAh, AA).

History and other information

and commercialised first by the Matsushita Company .

see discussion in "History..." on earlier invention and pioneering
development (1964) and patent application filed in 1967.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common penlight-size (AA) batteries have nominal capacities *C* ranging
from 1100 [mA·h](/wiki/Milliampere-hour "wikilink") to 2700 mA·h at 1.2 V,
usually rated at 0.2×*C* rate. Useful discharge capacity is an inverse
function of the discharge rate, but up to around 1×*C* rate, there is no
significant difference. NiMH batteries have an
[alkaline](alkaline "wikilink") [electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink"),
usually [potassium hydroxide](potassium_hydroxide "wikilink"). The
specific [energy density](energy_density "wikilink") for NiMH material
is approximately
70 [W·h](watt-hour "wikilink")/[kg](kilogram "wikilink") (250 kJ/kg),
with a volumetric [energy density](energy_density "wikilink") of about
300 W·h/[L](/wiki/Liter "wikilink") (360 MJ/m³).

Sometimes, voltage-sensitive devices won't perform well because the
voltage is lower than disposable batteries at equivalent sizes. Even
though the voltage is lower, it can be beneficial for the length of the
discharge cycle.

Cadmium is poisonous, so NiMH batteries are less detrimental to the
environment than NiCd batteries. [Battery
recycling](/wiki/Recycling#Batteries "wikilink") programs exist to take care
of end-of-life batteries.

Chemistry
---------

The [anode](anode "wikilink") reaction occurring in a NiMH battery is as
follows: H<sub>2</sub>O + Mm + e<sup>−</sup> ↔ OH<sup>−</sup> + Mm-H The
battery is charged in the right direction of this equation and
discharged in the left direction. [Nickel(II)
hydroxide](/wiki/Nickel(II)_hydroxide "wikilink") forms the cathode.

The "metal" in a NiMH battery is actually an
[intermetallic](intermetallic "wikilink") compound. Many different
compounds have been developed for this application, but those in current
use fall into two classes. The most common is AB<sub>5</sub>, where A is
a [rare earth](rare_earth_element "wikilink") mixture of
[lanthanum](lanthanum "wikilink"), [cerium](cerium "wikilink"),
[neodymium](neodymium "wikilink"),
[praseodymium](praseodymium "wikilink") and B is
[nickel](nickel "wikilink"), [cobalt](cobalt "wikilink"),
[manganese](manganese "wikilink"), and/or
[aluminum](aluminum "wikilink"). Very few batteries use higher-capacity
negative material electrodes based on AB<sub>2</sub> compounds, where A
is titanium and/or [vanadium](vanadium "wikilink") and B is
[zirconium](zirconium "wikilink") or nickel, modified with
[chromium](chromium "wikilink"), cobalt, [iron](iron "wikilink"), and/or
manganese, due to the reduced life performances
[3](http://www.cobasys.com/pdf/tutorial/inside_nimh_battery_technology.pdf).

Any of these compounds serves the same role, reversibly forming a
mixture of metal hydride compounds. When [hydrogen
ions](hydrogen_ion "wikilink") are forced out of the [potassium
hydroxide](potassium_hydroxide "wikilink")
[electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink") solution by the
[voltage](voltage "wikilink") applied during charging, this process
prevents them from forming a gas, allowing a low pressure and volume to
be maintained. As the battery is discharged, these same
[ions](ion "wikilink") are released to participate in the reverse
reaction.

Advantages vs. Alkaline
-----------------------

NiMH batteries and chargers are readily available in retail stores in
common sizes: AAA, AA, C and D. They are not expensive, and the voltage
and performance is similar to standard Alkaline batteries in those
sizes; they can be substituted for most purposes -- digital cameras are
a particularly good use. The ability to recharge hundreds of times can
save a lot of money and resources. Unlike NiCd rechargable batteries,
NiMH do not contain heavy metals, or other materials of special concern.
The drawback of NiMH is that they lose about 1% of their charge per day.
This is not a problem in the short term, but makes them unsuitable for
many light-duty uses, such as clocks, remote controls or safety devices,
where the battery would normally be expected to last many months or
years.

NiMH batteries are particularly advantageous for high current drain
applications. Alkaline batteries, which might have approximately 3000mAh
capacity under low current demand (200mA) will have less than 1000mAh
capacity under 1000mA (reference). Digital cameras with LCD's and flash
lights can drain over 1A, quickly depleting Alkaline batteries after few
shots. NiMH can handle these current levels and maintain their full
capacity.

Applications that require frequent replacement of the battery, such as
toys or video game controllers also benefit from use of rechargeable
batteries. With the development of low self discharge NiMH's (see
section above), many of occasional use applications can be replaced with
NiMH rechargeables.

[Lithium ion](/wiki/Lithium_ion "wikilink") batteries are more compact than
nickel metal hydride batteries.[1]
