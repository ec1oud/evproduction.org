*This page is about EV batteries.*

In science and technology, a [galvanic cell](galvanic_cell "wikilink")
is an electrochemical cell that stores chemical
[energy](energy "wikilink") and makes it available in an electrical
form, and a **battery** is a string of two or more cells in series.
Other types of electrochemical cell include [electrolytic
cells](electrolytic_cell "wikilink"), [fuel
cells](fuel_cell "wikilink"), or [voltaic
cells](voltaic_cell "wikilink").[1] The modern development of batteries
started with the [Voltaic pile](/wiki/Voltaic_pile "wikilink"), invented by
the Italian physicist [Alessandro Volta](/wiki/Alessandro_Volta "wikilink") in
1800.[2] According to a 2005 estimate, the worldwide battery industry
generates [US$](/wiki/United_States_dollar "wikilink")48
[billion](1000000000_(number) "wikilink") in sales annually.[3]

Formally, an electrical "battery" is a series-connected array of similar
*voltaic cells* ("cells"). However, in many contexts it is common to
call a single cell as a *battery*.[4]

History
-------

![A Voltaic Pile, the first
battery.](DSC03487.jpg "A Voltaic Pile, the first battery.")

The earliest known artifacts that may have served as batteries are the
[Baghdad Batteries](/wiki/Baghdad_Battery "wikilink"), which existed some time
between [250 BC](250_BC "wikilink") and [640 AD](640 "wikilink").
However, it is not known what electrical function they may have served,
and if they were in fact batteries at all. Scientists have developed
several theories about its use, including
[medicine](medicine "wikilink") (as a
[painkiller](painkiller "wikilink")) and
[electroplating](electroplating "wikilink") jewelry.[5]

The story of the modern battery begins in the [1780s](1780s "wikilink")
with the discovery of "animal electricity" by [Luigi
Galvani](/wiki/Luigi_Galvani "wikilink"), which he published in
[1791](1791 "wikilink").[6] He created an [electric
circuit](electric_circuit "wikilink") consisting of two different
metals, with one touching a frog's leg and the other touching both the
leg and the first metal, thus closing the circuit. In modern terms, the
frog's leg served as both [electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink") and
[detector](electrolytic_detector "wikilink"), and the metals served as
[electrodes](electrode "wikilink"). He noticed that even though the frog
was dead, its legs would twitch when he touched them with the metals.[7]

By [1791](1791 "wikilink"), [Alessandro
Volta](/wiki/Alessandro_Volta "wikilink") realized that the frog could be
replaced by cardboard soaked in salt water, employing another form of
detection. Having already studied the electrostatic phenomenon of
[capacitance](capacitance "wikilink"), Volta was able to quantitatively
measure the [electromotive force](electromotive_force "wikilink") (emf)
associated with each electrode-electrolyte interface
([voltage](voltage "wikilink")) in [volts](volt "wikilink"), which were
named after him. Such a device is called a [voltaic
cell](voltaic_cell "wikilink"), or cell for short. In
[1799](1799 "wikilink"), Volta invented the modern battery by placing
many galvanic cells in
[series](/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits#Series_circuits "wikilink"),
literally piling them one above the other. This [Voltaic
Pile](/wiki/Voltaic_Pile "wikilink") gave a greatly enhanced net emf for the
combination,[8] with a voltage of about 50 volts for a 32-cell pile.[9]
In many parts of Europe batteries continue to be called piles.
Unfortunately, Volta did not appreciate that the voltage was due to
chemical reactions. He thought that his cells were an inexhaustible
source of energy, and that the associated chemical effects (e.g.,
corrosion) were a mere nuisance -- rather than, as [Michael
Faraday](/wiki/Michael_Faraday "wikilink") showed around 1830, an unavoidable
by-product of their operation.

Later, researchers placed galvanic cells in
[series](/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits#Series_circuits "wikilink"). Such
banks of cells are called batteries, presumably after the earlier use by
[Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "wikilink") to describe [Leyden
jars](/wiki/Leyden_jar "wikilink") ([capacitors](capacitor "wikilink")) in
series and in parallel.[10]

Although early batteries were of great value for experimental purposes,
their limitations made them impractical for large current drain. Later,
batteries, starting with the [Daniell cell](/wiki/Daniell_cell "wikilink") in
[1836](1836 "wikilink"), provided more reliable currents and were
adopted by industry for use in stationary devices, particularly in
telegraph networks where they were the only practical source of
electricity, since electrical distribution networks did not exist
then.[11] These wet cells used liquid electrolytes, which were prone to
leaks and spillage if not handled correctly. Many used glass jars to
hold their components, which made them fragile. These characteristics
made wet cells unsuitable for portable appliances. Near the end of the
19th century, the invention of dry cell batteries, which replaced liquid
electrolyte with a paste made portable electrical devices practical.

How batteries work
------------------

![ One example of a galvanic cell, element of a
battery](Galvanic_cell.png "fig: One example of a galvanic cell, element of a battery")
A battery is a device in which chemical energy is directly converted to
electrical energy.[12] It consists of one or more voltaic cells, each of
which comprises two [half cells](half_cell "wikilink") connected in
series by the conductive electrolyte. A battery consists of one or more
voltaic cells in series. Each cell has a positive electrode (cathode),
and a negative electrode (anode). These do not touch each other but are
immersed in a solid or liquid electrolyte.[13] In a practical cell the
materials are enclosed in a container, and a separator between the
electrodes prevents them from touching one another.

Each half cell has a net [electromotive
force](electromotive_force "wikilink") (or
[voltage](voltage "wikilink")), with the net voltage of the battery
being the difference between the voltages of the half-cells. The
electrical potential difference across the terminals of a battery is
known as its *terminal voltage*, measured in [volts](volt "wikilink").
The terminal voltage of a battery that is neither charging nor
discharging is called the [open-circuit
voltage](open-circuit_voltage "wikilink"). The terminal voltage of a
battery that is discharging is smaller in magnitude than the
open-circuit voltage, and the terminal voltage of a battery being
charged is greater than the open-circuit voltage. [14]

The voltage developed across a cell's terminals depends on the chemicals
used in it and their concentrations. For example, alkaline and
carbon-zinc cells both measure about 1.5 volts, due to the energy
release of the associated chemical reactions. Because of the high
electrochemical potential changes in the reactions of
[lithium](lithium "wikilink") compounds, lithium cells can provide as
much as 3 volts or more.

Classification of batteries
---------------------------

Batteries are usually divided into two broad classes:

-   *Primary* batteries irreversibly transform chemical energy to
    electrical energy. Once the initial supply of reactants is
    exhausted, energy cannot be readily restored to the battery by
    electrical means.
-   *Secondary* batteries can be recharged, that is, have their chemical
    reactions reversed by supplying electrical energy to the cell,
    restoring their original composition.[15]

Historically, some types of primary batteries used, for example, for
[telegraph](telegraph "wikilink") circuits, were restored to operation
by replacing the components of the battery consumed by the chemical
reaction. Secondary batteries are not indefinitely rechargeable due to
dissipation of the active materials, loss of electrolyte, and internal
corrosion.

Battery capacity and discharging
--------------------------------

![Various examples of some of the most common battery
types.](Batteries.jpg "fig:Various examples of some of the most common battery types.")
The more electrolyte and electrode material there is in the cell, the
greater the capacity of the cell. Thus a small cell has less capacity
than a larger cell, given the same chemistry (e.g. [alkaline
cells](alkaline_cell "wikilink")), though they develop the same
open-circuit voltage.[16]

Because of the chemical reactions within the cells, the capacity of a
battery depends on the [discharge](discharge "wikilink") conditions such
as the magnitude of the current, the duration of the current, the
allowable terminal voltage of the battery, temperature, and other
factors.[17]

The available capacity of a battery depends upon the rate at which it is
discharged.[18] If a battery is discharged at a relatively high rate,
the available capacity will be lower than expected. Therefore, a battery
rated at 100 A·h will deliver 5 A over a 20 hour period, but if it is
instead discharged at 50 A, it will run out of charge before the
theoretically expected 2 hours. For this reason, a battery capacity
rating is always related to an expected discharge duration, such as 15
minutes, 8 hours, 20 hours or others.

The relationship between current, discharge time, and capacity for a
lead acid battery is expressed by [Peukert's
law](/wiki/Peukert's_law "wikilink"). The [efficiency](efficiency "wikilink")
of a battery is different at different discharge rates. When discharging
at low rate, the battery's energy is delivered more efficiently than at
higher discharge rates.

Battery manufacturers use a standard method to rate their batteries. The
battery is discharged at a constant rate of current over a fixed period
of time, such as 10 hours or 20 hours, down to a predetermined terminal
voltage per cell. So a 100 ampere-hour battery is rated to provide 5 A
for 20 hours at [room temperature](room_temperature "wikilink").
Ampere-hours are commonly called amp-hours.

In general, the higher the ampere-hour rating, the longer the battery
will last for a certain load. Installing batteries with different A·h
ratings will not affect the operation of a device rated for a specific
voltage.

Conversion to energy
--------------------

The ampere-hour (A·h) rating of a battery is related to the amount of
[energy](energy "wikilink") it stores when fully charged.[22] If two
batteries have the same nominal [voltage](voltage "wikilink"), then the
one with the higher A·h rating stores more energy. It also typically
takes longer to recharge. Accurate calculation of the energy stored in
the battery is complex due to the varying terminal voltage during
discharge (and so the need to specify an end terminal voltage for
discharge), and due to the dependency of total capacity on the discharge
rate and discharge duty.

Secondary batteries always yield less energy than was used to charge
them, since (among other reasons) the terminal voltage during charging
is higher than during discharging. The nickel cadmium and nickel
metal-hydride designs have efficiencies of around 66%.[23] However,
modern lithium designs have almost negated this wastage as they can have
efficiencies of around 99%.[24]

Battery lifetime
----------------

Even if never taken out of the original package, disposable (or
"primary") batteries can lose two to twenty-five percent of their
original charge every year. This is known as the "self discharge" rate
and is due to non-current-producing "side" chemical reactions, which
occur within the cell even if no load is applied to it. The rate of the
side reactions is reduced if the batteries are stored at low
temperature, although some batteries can be damaged by freezing. High or
low temperatures may reduce battery performance.

Rechargeable batteries traditionally self-discharge more rapidly than
disposable alkaline batteries; up to three percent a day (depending on
temperature), but modern Lithium designs have reduced the self discharge
to a relatively low level (but still poorer than primary technology).
Due to their poor shelf life, they should not be stored and then relied
upon to power flashlights or radios in an emergency. For this reason, it
is a good idea to keep alkaline batteries on hand. NiCd Batteries are
almost always "dead" when purchased, and must be charged before first
use.

Most NiMH and NiCd batteries can be charged several hundred times. Also,
they both can be completely discharged and then recharged without their
capacity being damaged or shortened.

Automotive lead-acid rechargeable batteries have a much harder life.
Because of vibration, shock, heat, cold, and sulfation of their lead
plates, few automotive batteries last beyond six years of regular use.
Automotive starting batteries have many thin plates to provide as many
amps as possible in a reasonably small package, and are only drained a
small amount before being immediately recharged. Care should be taken to
avoid deep discharging a starting battery, since each [charge and
discharge cycle](charge_and_discharge_cycle "wikilink") causes active
material to be shed from the plates. When holes form in the plates it
results in less surface area for the chemical reaction, which results in
less available voltage when under load. Leaving a lead-acid battery in a
deeply discharged state for any significant length of time allows the
lead sulfate to crystallize, making it difficult or impossible to remove
during the charging process. This can result in a permanent reduction in
the available plate surface and therefore reduced current output and
energy capacity. "Deep-Cycle" lead-acid batteries such as those used in
electric golf carts have much thicker plates to aid their longevity. The
main benefit of lead-acid is its low cost; the main drawbacks are its
large size and weight per a given capacity and voltage. Lead-acid
batteries should never be discharged to below 20% of their full capacity
as internal resistance will cause heat and damage when attempting to
recharge them. Deep-cycle lead-acid systems often use a low-charge
warning light or a low-charge power cut-off switch to prevent the type
of damage that will shorten the battery's life.

Special "reserve" batteries intended for long storage in emergency
equipment or munitions keep the electrolyte of the battery separate from
the plates until the battery is activated, allowing the cells to be
filled with the electrolyte. Shelf times for such batteries can be years
or decades. However, their construction is more expensive than more
common forms.

Battery life can be extended by storing the batteries at a low
temperature, as in a [refrigerator](refrigerator "wikilink") or
[freezer](freezer "wikilink"), because the chemical reactions in the
batteries are slower. Such storage can extend the life of alkaline
batteries by an insignificant 5%; however, the charge of rechargeable
batteries can be extended dramatically from a few days to several
months.[25] In order to reach their full power, batteries must be
returned to room temperature; therefore, alkaline battery manufacturers
like [Duracell](/wiki/Duracell "wikilink") do not recommend refrigerating or
freezing batteries.[26]

Environmental considerations
----------------------------

Since their development over 250 years ago, batteries have remained
among the most expensive energy sources, and their manufacturing
consumes many valuable resources and often involves hazardous chemicals.
For this reason many areas now have battery
[recycling](recycling "wikilink") services available to recover some of
the more toxic (and sometimes valuable) materials from used batteries.
Batteries may be harmful or fatal if [swallowed](swallowing "wikilink").
It is also important to prevent dangerous elements found in some
batteries, such as lead, [mercury](mercury_(element) "wikilink"),
[cadmium](cadmium "wikilink"), from entering the environment.

Effect of a battery's internal resistance
-----------------------------------------

A battery can be simply modeled as a perfect voltage source (i.e. one
with zero internal [resistance](electrical_resistance "wikilink")) in
series with a [resistor](resistor "wikilink"). The voltage source
depends mainly on the chemistry of the battery, not on whether it is
empty or full. When a battery runs down, its internal
[resistance](electrical_resistance "wikilink") increases. When the
battery is connected to a load (e.g. a [light
bulb](light_bulb "wikilink")), which has its own resistance, the
resulting voltage across the load depends on the ratio of the battery's
[internal resistance](internal_resistance "wikilink") to the resistance
of the load. When the battery is fresh, its internal resistance is low,
so the voltage across the load is almost equal to that of the battery's
internal voltage source. As the battery runs down and its internal
resistance increases, the voltage drop across its internal resistance
increases, so the voltage at its terminals decreases, and the battery's
ability to deliver [power](/wiki/Electric_power "wikilink") to the load
decreases.

The formula for calculating the voltage V<sub>t</sub> at the terminals
of a battery is:

*V*<sub>*t*</sub> = *V*<sub>*o**c*</sub> − *R*<sub>*i*</sub> ⋅ *I*
where

*V*<sub>*o**c*</sub>
is the open-circuit voltage of the battery

*R*<sub>*i*</sub>
is the battery's internal resistance

*I*
is the current flowing through the battery This can be rearranged to
calculate the internal resistance given the other quantities:

$$R\_i=\\frac {V\_{oc}-V\_t} {I}$$

Battery explosion
-----------------

A battery explosion is caused by the misuse or malfunction of a battery,
such as attempting to recharge a primary (non-rechargeable) battery, or
[short circuiting](short_circuit "wikilink") a battery. With car
batteries, explosions are most likely to occur when a short circuit
generates very large currents. In addition, car batteries liberate
[hydrogen](hydrogen "wikilink") when they are overcharged (because of
[electrolysis](electrolysis "wikilink") of the water in the
electrolyte). Normally the amount of overcharging is very small, as is
the amount of explosive gas developed, and the gas dissipates quickly.
However, when "jumping" a car battery, the high current can cause the
rapid release of large volumes of hydrogen, which can be ignited by a
nearby spark (for example, when removing the jumper cables).

When a battery is recharged at an excessive rate, an explosive gas
mixture of hydrogen and oxygen may be produced faster than it can escape
from within the walls of the battery, leading to pressure build-up and
the possibility of the battery case bursting. In extreme cases, the
battery acid may spray violently from the casing of the battery and
cause injury.

Additionally, disposing of a battery in fire may cause an explosion as
steam builds up within the sealed case of the battery.

Overcharging -- that is, attempting to charge a battery beyond its
electrical capacity -- can also lead to a battery explosion, leakage, or
irreversible damage to the battery. It may also cause damage to the
charger or device in which the overcharged battery is later used.

Types of batteries
------------------

[framed\|Various batteries (clockwise from bottom left): two 9-volt, two

camcorder battery, one "C" and two
"AAA"](image:batteries.jpg "wikilink") ![From top to bottom: Two [button

*3R12*](Batterien.jpg "fig:From top to bottom: Two button cells, a 9 volt ''PP3 battery, a AAA battery, a AA battery, a C battery, a D battery, a large 3R12")

From a user's viewpoint, at least, batteries can be generally divided
into two main types: *non-rechargeable
([disposable](disposable "wikilink"))* and
*[rechargeable](rechargeable_battery "wikilink")*. Each is in wide
usage.

Disposable batteries, also called *primary cells*, are intended to be
used once and discarded. These are most commonly used in portable
devices with either low current drain, only used intermittently, or used
well away from an alternative power source. Primary cells were also
commonly used for alarm and communication circuits where other electric
power was only intermittently available. Primary cells cannot be
reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily
reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms.
Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary
cells, although some electronics enthusiasts claim it is possible to do
so using a special type of charger.[27]

By contrast, rechargeable batteries or *secondary cells* can be
re-charged by applying electrical current, which reverses the [chemical
reactions](chemical_reactions "wikilink") that occur in use. Devices to
supply the appropriate current are called chargers or rechargers.

The oldest form of rechargeable battery still in modern usage is the
"[wet cell](wet_cell "wikilink")" [lead-acid
battery](lead-acid_battery "wikilink"). This battery is notable in that
it contains a liquid in an unsealed container, requiring that the
battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe
dispersal of the [hydrogen](hydrogen "wikilink") gas produced by these
batteries during overcharging. The lead-acid battery is also very heavy
for the amount of electrical energy it can supply. Despite this, its low
manufacturing cost and its high surge current levels make its use common
where a large capacity (over approximately 10Ah) is required or where
the weight and ease of handling are not concerns.

A common form of lead-acid battery is the modern wet-cell [car
battery](car_battery "wikilink"). This can deliver about 10,000
[watts](watt "wikilink") of power for a short period, and has a peak
current output that varies from 450 to 1100
[amperes](ampere "wikilink"). An improved type of lead-acid battery
called a *[gel battery](gel_battery "wikilink")* (or "gel cell") has
become popular in automotive industry as a replacement for the lead-acid
wet cell. The gel battery contains a semi-solid electrolyte to prevent
spillage, electrolyte evaporation, and out-gassing, as well as greatly
improving its resistance to damage from vibration and heat. Another type
of battery, the *[Absorbed Glass Mat](/wiki/Absorbed_Glass_Mat "wikilink")*
(AGM) suspends the electrolyte in a special fiberglass matting to
achieve similar results. More portable rechargeable batteries include
several "dry cell" types, which are sealed units and are therefore
useful in appliances like [mobile phones](mobile_phone "wikilink") and
[laptops](laptop "wikilink"). Cells of this type (in order of increasing
[power density](power_density "wikilink") and cost) include
[nickel-cadmium](nickel-cadmium_battery "wikilink") (NiCd), [nickel
metal hydride](nickel_metal_hydride_battery "wikilink") (NiMH), and
[lithium-ion](lithium_ion_battery "wikilink") (Li-Ion) cells.

### Rechargeable

  

Also known as secondary batteries or accumulators.

-   [Lead-acid battery](/wiki/Lead-acid_battery "wikilink") - used in
    vehicles, alarm systems and [uninterruptible power
    supplies](uninterruptible_power_supply "wikilink"). The major
    advantage of this chemistry is its low cost - a large lead-acid
    battery (e.g. 70Ah) is relatively inexpensive compared to batteries
    based on other chemistries, but this is most likely due to its
    popularity. However, this historically important battery type has a
    lower energy/mass than other battery types now available (see
    below).

    light battery that will store a lot of energy) and shows no "[memory
    effect](memory_effect "wikilink")". Lithium ion batteries are now

    Ni-MH types. This chemistry gives the longest cycle life (over 1500
    cycles), but has low energy/mass compared to Li-Ion and Ni-MH. Ni-Cd

    attractive technology had the highest energy density (prior to

    The worldwide rise in silver prices saw its demise. It was used as
    the power source for the 'moon buggy' on the later Apollo moon
    missions.

### Flow batteries

[Flow batteries](/wiki/Flow_Battery "wikilink") are a special class of battery
where additional quantities of [electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink") are
stored outside the main power cell of the battery, and circulated
through it by pumps or by movement. Flow batteries can have extremely
large capacities and are used in marine applications and are gaining
popularity in [grid energy storage](grid_energy_storage "wikilink")
applications.

[Zinc-bromine](/wiki/Zinc-bromine_flow_battery "wikilink") and [vanadium redox
batteries](/wiki/Vanadium_redox_battery "wikilink") are typical examples of
commercially-available flow batteries.

### Homemade cells

Almost any liquid or moist object that has enough ions to be
electrically conductive can serve as the electrolyte for a cell. As a
novelty or science demonstration, it is possible to insert two
electrodes made of different metals into a
[lemon](/wiki/Lemon_battery "wikilink")[29], [potato](potato "wikilink")[30],
etc. and generate small amounts of electricity. "Two-potato clocks" are
also widely available in hobby and toy stores; they consist of a pair of
cells, each consisting of a potato (lemon, etc.) with two electrodes
inserted into it, wired in series to form a battery with enough voltage
to power a digital clock.[31] Homemade cells of this kind are of no real
practical use, because they produce far less current—and cost far more
per unit of energy generated—than commercial cells, due to the need for
frequent replacement of the fruit or vegetable. In addition, one can
make a [voltaic pile](voltaic_pile "wikilink") from two coins (such as a
[nickel](nickel "wikilink") and a [penny](penny "wikilink")) and a piece
of [paper towel](paper_towel "wikilink") dipped in [salt
water](saline_water "wikilink"). Such a pile would make very little
voltage itself, but when many of them are stacked together in
[series](series_circuit "wikilink"), they can replace normal batteries
for a short amount of time.[32]

Lead acid cells can easily be manufactured at home, but a tedious
charge/discharge cycle is needed to 'form' the plates. This is a process
whereby lead sulfate forms on the plates, and during charge is converted
to lead dioxide (positive plate) and pure lead (negative plate).
Repeating this process results in a microscopically rough surface, with
far greater surface area being exposed. This increases the current the
cell can deliver. For an example, see
[2](http://windpower.org.za/batteries/batteries.html).

### Battery packs

The cells in a battery can be connected in parallel, series, or in both.
A parallel combination of cells has the same
[voltage](voltage "wikilink") as a single cell, but can supply a higher
[current](/wiki/Current_(electricity) "wikilink") (the sum of the currents
from all the cells). A series combination has the same current rating as
a single cell but its voltage is the sum of the voltages of all the
cells. Most practical electrochemical batteries, such as 9
[volt](volt "wikilink") flashlight (torch) batteries and 12 V
[automobile](automobile "wikilink") (car) batteries, have several cells
connected in series inside the casing. Parallel arrangements suffer from
the problem that, if one cell discharges faster than its neighbour,
current will flow from the full cell to the empty cell, wasting power
and possibly causing overheating. Even worse, if one cell becomes
short-circuited due to an internal fault, its neighbour will be forced
to discharge its maximum current into the faulty cell, leading to
overheating and possibly explosion. Cells in parallel are therefore
usually fitted with an electronic circuit to protect them against these
problems. In both series and parallel types, the energy stored in the
battery is equal to the sum of the energies stored in all the cells.

#### Traction batteries

Traction batteries are high-power batteries designed to provide
propulsion to move a vehicle, such as an [electric
car](electric_car "wikilink") or tow motor. A major design consideration
is [power to weight ratio](power_to_weight_ratio "wikilink") since the
vehicle must carry the battery. While conventional lead acid batteries
with liquid electrolyte have been used, gelled electrolyte and
([AGM-type](/wiki/Absorbed_Glass_Mat "wikilink")) can also be used, especially
in smaller sizes. The largest installations of batteries for propulsion
of vehicles are found in [submarines](submarine "wikilink"), although
the toxic gas produced by seawater contact with acid electrolyte is a
considerable hazard.

Battery types commercially used in electric vehicles include:

-   [lead-acid battery](lead-acid_battery "wikilink")
    -   flooded type with liquid electrolyte.
    -   [AGM-type (Absorbed Glass Mat)](/wiki/Absorbed_Glass_Mat "wikilink")
-   [Zebra Na/NiCl<sub>2</sub>](/wiki/Molten_salt_battery "wikilink") battery
    operating at 270 °C requiring cooling in case of temperature
    excursions
-   [NiZn battery](/wiki/NiZn_battery "wikilink") (higher cell voltage 1.6 V
    and thus 25% increased specific energy, very short lifespan)

vehicle](hydrogen_vehicle "wikilink").

Glossary
--------

Some common battery-related terms:

-   [W](/wiki/W "wikilink"): [watt](watt "wikilink"), unit of power. One watt
    equals one [joule](joule "wikilink") per second.
-   W/kg: watts per kilogram, unit of power per mass.
-   W/l: watts per liter, unit of power density.
-   [W•h](/wiki/W•h "wikilink"): [watt-hour](watt-hour "wikilink"), unit of
    energy, or work. 1 watt expended continuously for 1 hour equals 1
    watt-hour.
-   W•h/kg: watt-hours per kilogram, unit of energy per mass.
-   W•h/l: watt-hours per litre, unit of energy density.
-   W•h/lb: watt-hours per pound, unit of energy per mass.
