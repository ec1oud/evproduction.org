The EV1 was the first purpose-built [[battery electric vehicle]] produced by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors (GM)]] in the [[United States]] and, at the time, was the only vehicle in the history of the company to bear the "General Motors" [[marque|badge]]. 

GM never offered the EV1 for public sale. It was only available to consumers under a lease program that had no clause allowing for purchase at the conclusion of the lease. 650 EV1s were produced for the 1997 model year, utilising [[lead acid batteries]]; each found a lessee. In 1999, GM switched the EV1 to a [[nickel metal hydride battery]]; 465 were produced, all were leased.

In 1999, the original 650 1997 EV1s were all returned to GM because of a "voluntary recall" to repair a cable from the charge port that GM claimed would lead to heat buildup and even fire.

In 2000, about 200 of the 1997 EV1s were re-issued to their original lessees on revised two-year leases.

Over the next 18 months, the remaining 200-odd 1999 EV1s were released, a few at a time, to selected lessees, mostly high-profile celebrities and politicians.

All EV1 leases required return of the vehicle at lease end, upon which GM sent them straight off to Mesa, AZ, where the tires and batteries were removed, they were subjected to an 18" crush, and then trucked back to a smelter near Fontana.  GM charged former lessees for excess wear and for scratches on the EV1s, and insisted on billing ex-lessees for these charges, even reporting non-payment as a charge-off.  GM consistently refused offers to purchase or re-lease any EV1s.  All the 1999 EV1s, with the exception of a few retained in Michigan proving grounds, were destroyed.  All the donated EV1s are the original 1997 version, disabled by removal of the controller and batteries.

The EV1 electric cars were available in  [[California]] and [[Arizona]] only and could be serviced at designated [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] retailers. 

==Origins==

The predecessor of the EV1, the Impact, driven into the Los Angeles Auto Show, ironically led to the Zero Emission Vehicle ("ZEV") Mandate in 1990 which was intended to force GM to produce the EV1.  Hence, the EV1 became [[sui generis]], in a sense.  EV1 thus became a political football, GM dragging its heels but forced to comply.  Other members of what was then the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, plus Toyota, Nissan and Honda, were forced to produce a prototype ZEV.  Honda presented the Honda EV Plus in 1998, the first production EV using Nickel Metal Hydride batteries and the first having a range over 100 miles on a charge.  Toyota presented the RAV4-EV, also using NiMH batteries, also with a range over 120 miles.  Nissan responded with the prismatic Lithium battery-powered Altra.

The most successful EV ever made, the [[Toyota RAV4 EV]], is still active in California in fleet and individual use, still running on the original pre-2002 Nickel Metal Hydride batteries and still retaining a range over 100 miles.  Most other EVs produced under the prodding of the ZEV Mandate were only issued on leases, and all have been destroyed by the lessor.

The ZEV Mandate originally specified that by 1998, 2% of all new cars sold by the seven major auto manufacturers in the state of California were to meet 'zero emission' standards as defined by the [[California Air Resources Board]].  While other manufacturers developed plans to address this mandate, the General Motors EV1 was the only vehicle which made it to the production phase.

Due to resistance by GM and other manufacturers, industry groups, and by Western States Petroleum Assn., the ZEV mandate was continually weakened and compliance standards lowered.  In 1999, ex-Governor Gray Davis appointed Dr. Lloyd, a proponent of Hydrogen Fuel Cells, to head the California Air Resources Board.  The dismantling of the ZEV mandate accelerated until, in dramatic Board meetings in March and April, 2003, an "alternative path" was created for auto makers to avoid battery-powered ZEV vehicles in favor of Fuel Cell (Type III ZEV) and compliance was back-ended to 2018.  Effectively, CARB gave permission for the auto makers to scrap all the then-existing ZEVs on the road.

==EV1 program cancellation==
In late 2003, GM officially cancelled the EV1 program<ref>{{cite web | first = David | last = Welch | coauthors = Woellert, Lorraine | title = The Eco-Cars | publisher = Business Week | url = http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_33/b3694130.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first = Michael | last = Taylor | title = Owners charged up over electric cars, but manufacturers have pulled the plug | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle | date = April 24, 2005 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/24/MNGDTCEA9B1.DTL | accessdate = 2007-01-07}}</ref> Despite unfulfilled waiting lists and positive feedback from the lessees, GM stated that it could not sell enough of the cars to make the EV1 profitable.  In fact, during the latter stages of development for the car, GM officials claimed that they stood no chance of ever making a profit on the EV1 itself.  

Instead, the company hoped that the EV1 would prove their technology and establish a "leadership" position within the Electric Vehicle market.  GM itself did not expect to turn a profit on electric vehicles for perhaps 10 years after bringing the EV1 to market. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} The end came when GM decided it was [[Cost-benefit analysis|cheaper to sue]] the State of California to roll back clean vehicle regulations than it was to build electric vehicles. GM believed the price of oil would remain low and people would always want SUVs<ref>{{cite web | first = Rick | last = Ostrov |coauthors = Porter, John | title = Hope For Humanity: New Solutions For the 21st Century | publisher = Education Press | url = http://www.speedreadingcourse.com/hopeforhumanity/02_theev2.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-08 }}</ref> rather than small electric cars.

GM stated that they spent over $1 billion developing and marketing the EV1, though a portion of this cost was defrayed by the Clinton Administration's $1.25 Billion Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) project. <ref>{{cite web | first = Fred | last = Sissine | title = The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles | publisher = Congressional Research Service | date = [[February 28]], [[1996]] | url = http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/energy/eng-9.cfm | accessdate = 2007-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{ cite press release | title = Remarks by the President at a Clean Car event | publisher = White House Press Secretary | date = [[September 29]], [[1993]] | url = http://clinton6.nara.gov/1993/09/1993-09-29-presidents-remarks-at-clean-car-event.html | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Accomplishments of the National Science and Technology Council | publisher = National Science and Technology Council | date = 1996 | url = http://www.ostp.gov/NSTC/html/1996_Accomplishments.html | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref>
All manufacturers seeking to produce electric cars for market consumption also benefitted from matching government funds committed to the [[United States Advanced Battery Consortium]].
The estimated research and development costs for the EV1 program to production (prior to marketing and sale costs) was pegged by General Motors as "slightly less than $500 Million".

When canceling the program, GM also cited a lack of demand for the two seater, particularly in light of its limited range and its suitability to "warm weather" states only. During the EV1's development phase, several Northeastern states moved to pass ZEV laws similar to those adopted in California.  General Motors, along with many other prospective EV manufacturers, opposed this movement despite the likelihood that such legislation would have vastly increased the market for the vehicle.  While this may seem a sinister position to have taken (some ardent EV supporters have claimed that GM sabotaged its own product potential by taking this step),  GM's internal research showed very clearly that the EV1's already perilously low range would be reduced by as much as 50% for use in cold-weather states.  This was due chiefly to the effect of ambient temperature on both the batteries performance and the special low rolling resistance tires.  

In 2001, the California Air Resources Board modified the ZEV Mandate<ref>{{cite web | title = Amendments to the California Zero Emission Vehicle Program Regulations | publisher = State of California Environmental Protection Agency | date = December 2001 | url = http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/zev2001/fsor.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref> to allow manufacturers to claim partial ZEV credit for [[hybrid vehicle]]s. General Motors and DaimlerChrysler then sued the state of California and CARB, alleging that the new ZEV rules violated a federal law barring states from regulating fuel economy.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Air Wars: California's Auto Emissions Laws | publisher = Public Broadcasting Service | date = [[April 15]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.pbs.org/now/science/caautoemissions2.html | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref>  In response, CARB removed the requirement for electric vehicles from the ZEV mandate in 2003, and GM - having produced a product for a mandate and market that no longer existed - cancelled the EV1 program soon after.<ref>{{cite web | title = Calif. Buckles on Zero Emissions | publisher = Reuters | date = [[August 12]], [[2003]] | url = http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,59995,00.html | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref>

The last private EV1 lease expired in August of 2004. Upon lease expiration, the cars were put into storage at a facility in [[Burbank, California]]. GM donated a small number of the returned EV1s to colleges and universities for engineering students, and to several museums including the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  However, most of the vehicles were quietly destroyed, much to the protest of their former drivers. By [[March 15]], [[2005]] the last 78 in storage had been transferred to the [[GM Desert Proving Grounds]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]] for disposal.  The EV1s sent to this site were stripped of their recyclables and crushed.

Over a hundred people offered to purchase the electric cars and waive such liability as they were able under American consumer product laws.  GM refused, stating that they would be subject to ongoing product liability from both the purchasers and any future owners, and that their internal customer support policies would require them to provide service and replacement parts for the EV1s for at least ten years. <ref>{{cite web | first = Josh | last = Landess | title = EV1 : Victim of Liability Laws? | publisher = EV World | date = [[November 24]], [[2002]] | url = http://www.evworld.com/view.cfm?section=article&archive=1&storyid=457 | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref> GM's suppliers stopped making replacement parts because of low demand, making it impossible to repair the vehicles<ref>>{{cite news | title = GM'S FORWARD PROGRESS: FACTS VERSUS FICTION | publisher = GM | date = [[June 23]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fastlane_Blog_2.html#EV1 | notes = "Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?"}}</ref>. Of particular concern to the company was the likelihood that each leased car's battery packs would require replacement at 25-35,000 mile intervals, and that the very low volumes involved would necessitate the corporation's subsidy of spare parts to private owners, perhaps on an indefinite basis. (As an example, the wholesale, or in house, cost of the battery pack to GM was still in the $2-3,000 dollar region during the production phase of the EV1 program.  Including delivery and installation, GM thought it unlikely an EV1 could be repowered for less than $6-7000 per unit)

The EV1 has been called a failure by business publications such as the Wall Street Journal <ref>{{cite news | title = GM, Toyota Keep Hybrid Bets Alive | publisher = Wall Street Journal | date = [[December 12]], [[2006]] | pages =  D7 | notes = "The EV1 was a failure, as were other electric vehicles"}}</ref> GM believes that the electric car venture was not a failure, and that the EV1 was doomed when the expected breakthrough in battery technology did not take place.<ref>The Arizona Republic, March 15th, 2005</ref> In fact, the NiMH battery packs (or [[Ovonic]] Battery) that were expected to dramatically improve range came with their own set of problems; GM had to use a less-efficient charging algorithm (lengthening charge times) and waste power on air conditioning to prevent the battery packs from overheating.<ref>{{cite web | first = Noel | last = Adams | title = Why is GM Crushing Their EV-1s? | publisher = Electrifying Times | date = [[December 2]], [[2001]] | url = http://www.electrifyingtimes.com/ev1crush.html | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref>   In addition, the elimination of the environmental mandate that lead to the car's creation was, as previously mentioned, a huge factor in the program's cancellation.  The EV1 could not have been created without the looming CARB 2% ZEV mandate in California.  It is clear that once the mandate was eliminated, the car would not continue to be produced. 

The view of the EV1 as failure is a controversial one in itself.  When viewed as an attempt to produce a commercially viable EV for market consumption, it seems clear the car did not succeed (the car could not be produced or maintained at a cost that consumers would have considered acceptable).  If one considers the vehicle from GM's perspective, as a technological showpiece - a production electric car that actually could replace a gas powered vehicle - the program's outcome is less clear.  The EV1 was produced for the consumer market, and many lessees found driving an EV1 to be a favorable experience.  On that basis, EV1 would qualify as the most successful electric car ever built.
Some analysts have suggested that it is inappropriate to compare the EV1 with existing gas powered commuter cars as the EV1 is, in effect, a completely new product and had no equivalent vehicles to be judged against.  Perhaps the largest disappointment to consumers is that, having invested the research time and money to invent the technology required to produce the EV1, GM did not continue development of future EV designs.  Effectively, the technological advantage GM built through this program was squandered.

It has recently been theorized by the documentary ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' that the EV1 program was eliminated because it posed a threat to the oil industry. Some still speculate about the role the oil industry played in canceling the EV1 program, although we will probably never know the real story behind the cancellation.  GM responded to the film's claims, laying out several reasons why the EV1 was not commercially viable at the time.<ref>>{{cite news | title = GM'S FORWARD PROGRESS: FACTS VERSUS FICTION | publisher = GM | date = [[June 23]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.gm.com/company/onlygm/fastlane_Blog_2.html#EV1 | notes = "Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?"}}</ref>

==Costs==
The price for the car used to compute lease payments was $33,995 to $43,995, which made for lease payments of $299 to over $574 per month. One industry official said that each EV1 cost the company about $80,000, including research, development and other associated costs.<ref>{{cite web | first = Greg | last = Schneider | title = The Electric-Car Slide | publisher = The Washington Post | date = [[October 22]], [[2003]] | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A61508-2003Oct21?language=printer | accessdate = 2007-01-08}} That would put GM's total investment at $89 Million, as 1115 cars were produced.</ref>  The vehicle's lease prices also depended on available state rebates. At the time of purchase, the cost for the electricity used to power the car was computed to be 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of the equivalent amount of gasoline <ref> Fuel costs can be estimated as follows: This article states the nickel-metal hydride batteries held 26.4 kWh of energy. According to the Wikipedia article on [[Electricity retailing]] the average cost of electricity is approximately $.106 per kWh. Therefore it would cost 26.4 x $.106 or $2.80 to fully charge the batteries, neglecting any losses in the charging system. The range of the vehicle was 75-150 miles, so it could travel approximately 100 miles at an electric cost of $2.80. If gasoline costs $2 / gallon and a similar car gets 30 miles / gallon then gasoline fuel costs are $6.67 to travel 100 miles. The electric "fuel cost" is approximately 41% of the gasoline fuel cost in this example. </ref>, and since that time increases in gas prices may have made electricity relatively even less expensive (depending on customer location, recharging time and electricity billing variations (some utilities have variable billing for peak vs non-peak usage rates)).

== Technology ==
The EV1 was a 'purpose built' electric vehicle, not a conversion of an existing vehicle or drivetrain.  The program was initially administered by Kenneth Baker, a GM Engineer who had previously managed the [[Electrovette]] program in the [[1970s]].  This program had been intended as an in-factory conversion of the Chevrolet Chevette to electric power, but did not reach production owing to technical and production cost difficulties.

General Motors used many advanced technologies in developing the EV1.  These included:
:*Aluminum frame
:*Dent resistant side-panels
:*Anti-lock brakes
:*Traction control
:*Heat pump (Heater/AC)
:*Keyless entry / keyless ignition
:*Special one-way thermal glass to allow for better heat rejection
:*Regenerative braking
:*Very low drag coefficient - [[Drag Coefficient|'''C<sub>d</sub>''']]~0.19, [[Drag Coefficient#CdA|'''C<sub>d</sub>A''']]~0.36&nbsp;m&sup2; (3.95&nbsp;ft&sup2;)
:*Super light alloy mag wheels
:*Self sealing & low-rolling resistance tires (developed by [[Michelin]])
:*Automated tire pressure loss warning system
:*Magnesium framed seats
:*Time programmable HVAC (cabin heating or cooling) settings

Most of these technologies were included to improve the overall efficiency of the EV1.

The first generation EV1s used [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] in [[1996]] (as model year 1997) and a second generation batch with [[nickel metal hydride]] batteries in [[1999]]. Some of the Gen 1 EV1s were refurbished and upgraded to Panasonic Lead Acid batteries. 

The Gen 1 cars got 55-to-75 miles (90-to-120 km) per charge with the Delco-manufactured lead-acid batteries, 75-to-100 miles (120-to-160 km) with the Gen 2 Panasonic lead-acid batteries, and 75-to-150 miles (120 to 240 km) per charge with Gen 2 Ovonic nickel-metal hydride batteries.  Recharging took as much as eight hours for a full charge (although one could get an 80% charge in two to three hours).  The battery pack consisted of 26 12-volt lead-acid batteries holding 67.4 MJ (18.7&nbsp;kWh) of energy or 26 13.2-volt nickel-metal hydride batteries which held 95.1 MJ (26.4&nbsp;kWh) of energy.

The EV1 was directly based on a prototype vehicle created by [[AeroVironment]] called the [[GM Impact]]. The Impact in turn was based on design ideas first tested out in a record-breaking race car called the [[Sunraycer]], a solar-electric vehicle the company created in 1987 specifically to win the [[Solar Challenge]], a trans-Australia race open to solar powered cars only.

A modified EV1 prototype set a [[land speed record]] for production electric vehicles of 183&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h) in [[1994]].

==Consumer experience==
The EV1 driving and ownership experience was unlike a conventional gasoline (petrol) or [[diesel]] vehicle. The EV1 had the lowest [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamic drag coefficient]] of any production vehicle in history, with a C<sub>d</sub> of 0.195, while typical production cars have C<sub>d</sub>'s in the 0.3 to 0.4 range.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Ins and Outs of Innovation | publisher = American Plastics Council | url = http://www.plastics-car.com/innovators/insandouts.html | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref> As a result, at highway speeds, the only audible noise was often the steady thrum of the tires, with nothing from wind or motors. At lower speeds, and at stoplights, there was no noise at all, save for a slight whine from the single-speed gear reduction unit. With its smooth shape and rear [[fender skirts]] it had a very distinctive appearance.


The EV1 could accelerate from 0-60mph in the 8 second range. The car's top speed was limited to 80 MPH due to gearing that was a design compromise between low-speed acceleration, vehicle top speed and motor speed and torque ranges. Vehicle operating information [[instrumentation]] was displayed by digital readouts spanning a thin curved strip just under the windshield and well above the dashboard. 

The home charger installation (required for "fast recharge") was about 1.5'x2'x5' with integrated [[heatsink]]s and resembled a gasoline pump. Charging itself was entirely inductive, and accomplished by placing a [[MagneCharge]] paddle in the front port of the EV1, although GM also offered a convenience charger (110/115/120VAC) that could be used in conjunction with any standard North American receptacle to slow charge the battery pack.

==EV1 drivetrain prototypes==
[[image:GM_EV1.jpg|thumb|right|EV1 shown plugged into charging station]] 
General Motors revealed several prototype variants of the EV1 drivetrain at the [[1998]] [[Detroit Auto Show]]. The models included [[Diesel engine|diesel]]/electric [[Hybrid vehicle#Parallel|parallel hybrid]], [[gas turbine]]/electric [[Hybrid vehicle#Series|series hybrid]], [[fuel cell]]/electric version and [[compressed natural gas]] low emission [[internal combustion engine]] version.<ref>{{cite web | first = Thor | last = Windbergs | title = Motoring into the New Millennium | publisher = Colorado Engineer Magazine | date  =1998 | url = http://cem.colorado.edu/archives/fl1998/thor.html | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref>  In addition, during this period, GM reorganized their electronics divisions (amongst them Hughes Electronics and Delco Divisions) into Delco Propulsion Systems in order to attempt to commercialize this technology in niche markets.  Several non-affiliated companies purchased inverter and drivetrain systems from DPS for vehicle/fleet conversion purposes.

The new platform was a four-passenger variant of the EV1, lengthened by 19".  This design was based on an internal (GM) program for a more "marketable" EV begun during the proof of concept phase of the EV1's development.  During the original EV1 R&D period, focus groups indicated one of the major market limiting factors of the original EV1 was it's two seater configuration.  GM investigated the possibility of making the EV1 a four seater, but ultimately determined that the increased length and weight of the four seater would reduce vehicle's already limited range to 40-50 miles - placing the first ground up electric car's performance squarely in the pack of aftermarket gas vehicle conversions.  Understandably, the company elected to produce the lighter two seater design.

For hybrid and electric vehicles, the battery pack was upgraded to 44 [[NiMH]] cells, arranged in "I" formation down the centerline, which could fully recharge in just 2 hours using onboard 220&nbsp;V induction charger; additional power units were installed in the trunk, thus complementing the 3rd generation 137 hp AC Induction electric motor installed in the hood. Hybrid modifications retained the capability of all-electric [[ZEV]] propulsion for up to 40 miles (64.4 km).

===EV1 CNG===
The CNG variant was the only non-electric vehicle in the line-up, even though it employed the same up-stretched platform. It used a modified [[Suzuki]] 1.0-liter [[turbo|turbocharged]] 3-cylinder all-aluminum [[OHC]] engine installed under the hood.  Due to the high octane rating of the CNG (allowing for a greater [[compression ratio]]), this small engine was able to deliver 72hp at 5500 rpm. 

The batteries were replaced with two CNG tanks capable of maximum operating pressure of 3000psi. The tanks could be refueled from a single nozzle in  only 4 minutes. In-tank solenoids shut off the fuel during refueling and engine idle, and a pressure relief device safeguarded against excessive temperature and pressure.  With the help of [[continuously variable transmission]], the car accelerated 0 to 60 mph (96.6 km/h) in 11 seconds. The maximum range was 350 to 400 miles, and fuel economy was 60mpg (in [[gasoline]] equivalent).

===EV1 series hybrid===
[[Image:GMEV1serieshybrid.jpg|thumb|right|200px|EV1 series hybrid prototype at EVS-16 in Beijing, 1999]]
The series hybrid prototype had a gas turbine engine [[Auxiliary power unit|APU]] placed in the trunk.  A single-stage, single-shaft, [[Recuperator|recuperated]] gas turbine unit with a high-speed permanent-magnet AC generator was provided by [[Williams International]]; it weighed 220 lb (99.8 kg), measured 20 inches (50.8 cm) in diameter by 22 inches (55.9 cm) long and was running between 100,000 and 140,000 rpm. The turbine could run on multiple fuels, from [[Gasoline#Oxygenate blending|reformulated gasoline]] to [[compressed natural gas]]. The APU started automatically when the battery charge dropped below 40% and delivered 40 kW of electrical power, enough to achieve speeds up to 80 mph (128.8 km/h) and to return the car's 44 [[NiMH]] cells to a 50% charge level. 

A fuel tank capacity of 6.5 gallons (24.6 l) and fuel economy of 60 to 100 mpg (3.9 to 2.4 L/100 km) in hybrid mode, depending on the driving conditions, allowed for a highway range of more than 390 miles (627.6 km).  The car accelerated to 0-60 mph (96.6 km/h) in 9 seconds.

===EV1 parallel hybrid===
The parallel hybrid variant featured 1.3 L [[turbocharged]] DTI diesel engine from [[Isuzu]] delivering 75 hp, installed in the trunk along with an additional 6.5 hp DC motor/generator; the two motors drove the rear wheels through an electronically controlled transaxle. When combined with the AC induction motor which powered the front wheels, all three power units delivered a total output of 219 hp, accelerating the car to 0-60 mph (96.6 km/h) in 7 seconds. A single tank of diesel fuel could keep the car running for 550 miles with a fuel economy of 80 mpg. 

A similar technology is used in the 2005 ''[[Opel Astra]] Diesel Hybrid'' concept.

===EV1 fuel cell===
This variant extended all-electric propulsion capabilities with a methanol-powered fuel cell system (developed by [[Daimler-Benz]]/[[Ballard Power Systems|Ballard]] for the [[Mercedes-Benz NECAR]]), again installed in the trunk. The system consisted of a fuel processor, an expander/compressor and the fuel cell stack.  The highway range  was about 300 miles, with a fuel economy of 80 mpg (in a gasoline equivalent). The car accelerated to 0-60 mph (96.6 km/h) in 9 seconds.

== Controversy ==
{{Unreferenced|date=December 2006}}

[[Image:evcrushed.jpg|thumb|left|EV1s crushed by [[General Motors]]|300px]]
Many consumers and government officials questioned General Motors' commitment to the EV1 program. Concerns over inadequate marketing and limited vehicle supply have led some to believe the EV1 program was intended to fail, and by doing so to prove that electric vehicles were not commercially viable with the then current level of technology.  General Motors position on this was very clear - they spent $500 million trying to produce a workable electric vehicle that could compete and win "heads up" in the marketplace.  If the company could have recouped their investment by selling the vehicles commercially, they said, they certainly would have done so.  In the hearts of ardent EV supporters, continuing doubts linger about motives, however.

The process of obtaining an EV1 was difficult when compared to the purchase of any other commuter car. The vehicle could not be purchased outright. Instead, General Motors offered a closed-end lease for three years, with no renewal or residual purchase option. The EV1 was only available from Saturn dealerships (then less prevalent than they are today), and only in California and Arizona (for technical reasons).

Before reviewing leasing options, a potential lessee would be taken through a 'pre-qualification' process in order to learn how the EV1 was different from other vehicles (a similar 'buyer familiarization process' was standard for all Saturn buyers). Following this, prospective lessees would be placed on a waiting list with no scheduled delivery date.  After an average wait of between two and six months, the lessee would be allotted a vehicle.  Installation of a home charger took one to two weeks and cost an additional $2500 (on average). 

Ardent supporters of electric vehicles have been very vocal about the program's demise.  Of particular interest is the leasing program which formally required the vehicles to be returned to GM at lease expiry.  General Motors stated reason for the lease-only basis was that, as the modern era's first ground up electric vehicle, the EV1 could not be expected to maintain its performance level (or affordability in regard to maintenance) over the long run.  GM also had significant concerns over long term liability issues relating to the vehicle.  This was partly due to the relatively short R&D period the car was designed and produced under, and the high percentage of "invented on schedule" technology employed in the car as compared with a standard gas powered vehicle.  While many lessees and prospective owners have complained about the lease-only availability of the EV1, it is important to note that each leased vehicle was in effect heavily subsidized by General Motors.  The car was very popular with its lessees, but it is not known if anyone would have purchased the vehicle had it been offered for sale even at a "break even" price of $35-40,000 USD.

According to GM Chairman and CEO [[Rick Wagoner]], the worst decision of his tenure at GM was "axing the EV1 electric-car program and not putting the right resources into hybrids. It didn’t affect profitability, but it did affect image."<ref>Motor Trend, June 2006, p. 94</ref> According to the March 13, 2007 issue of ''Newsweek'', "GM R&D chief Larry Burns . . . now wishes GM hadn't killed the plug-in hybrid EV1 prototype his engineers had on the road a decade ago: 'If we could turn back the hands of time,' says Burns, 'we could have had the Chevy Volt 10 years earlier.'" <ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17437402/site/newsweek/page/4/</ref>

A documentary about the demise of the EV1 and other electric vehicles entitled ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' debuted on [[June 30]], [[2006]].  
Several weeks before the debut of the movie, the Smithsonian Institution announced that its EV1 display was being permanently removed and the EV1 car put into storage.
