The EV1 was the first purpose-built [battery electric
vehicle](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") produced by [General
Motors (GM)](/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation "wikilink") in the [United
States](/wiki/United_States "wikilink") and, at the time, was the only vehicle
in the history of the company to bear the "General Motors"
[badge](marque "wikilink").

GM never offered the EV1 for public sale. It was only available to
consumers under a lease program that had no clause allowing for purchase
at the conclusion of the lease. 650 EV1s were produced for the 1997
model year, utilising [lead acid
batteries](lead_acid_batteries "wikilink"); each found a lessee. In
1999, GM switched the EV1 to a [nickel metal hydride
battery](nickel_metal_hydride_battery "wikilink"); 465 were produced,
all were leased.

In 1999, the original 650 1997 EV1s were all returned to GM because of a
"voluntary recall" to repair a cable from the charge port that GM
claimed would lead to heat buildup and even fire.

In 2000, about 200 of the 1997 EV1s were re-issued to their original
lessees on revised two-year leases.

Over the next 18 months, the remaining 200-odd 1999 EV1s were released,
a few at a time, to selected lessees, mostly high-profile celebrities
and politicians.

All EV1 leases required return of the vehicle at lease end, upon which
GM sent them straight off to Mesa, AZ, where the tires and batteries
were removed, they were subjected to an 18" crush, and then trucked back
to a smelter near Fontana. GM charged former lessees for excess wear and
for scratches on the EV1s, and insisted on billing ex-lessees for these
charges, even reporting non-payment as a charge-off. GM consistently
refused offers to purchase or re-lease any EV1s. All the 1999 EV1s, with
the exception of a few retained in Michigan proving grounds, were
destroyed. All the donated EV1s are the original 1997 version, disabled
by removal of the controller and batteries.

The EV1 electric cars were available in
[California](/wiki/California "wikilink") and [Arizona](Arizona "wikilink")
only and could be serviced at designated
[Saturn](/wiki/Saturn_Corporation "wikilink") retailers.

Origins
-------

The predecessor of the EV1, the Impact, driven into the Los Angeles Auto
Show, ironically led to the Zero Emission Vehicle ("ZEV") Mandate in
1990 which was intended to force GM to produce the EV1. Hence, the EV1
became [sui generis](sui_generis "wikilink"), in a sense. EV1 thus
became a political football, GM dragging its heels but forced to comply.
Other members of what was then the American Automobile Manufacturers
Association, plus Toyota, Nissan and Honda, were forced to produce a
prototype ZEV. Honda presented the Honda EV Plus in 1998, the first
production EV using Nickel Metal Hydride batteries and the first having
a range over 100 miles on a charge. Toyota presented the RAV4-EV, also
using NiMH batteries, also with a range over 120 miles. Nissan responded
with the prismatic Lithium battery-powered Altra.

The most successful EV ever made, the [Toyota RAV4
EV](/wiki/Toyota_RAV4_EV "wikilink"), is still active in California in fleet
and individual use, still running on the original pre-2002 Nickel Metal
Hydride batteries and still retaining a range over 100 miles. Most other
EVs produced under the prodding of the ZEV Mandate were only issued on
leases, and all have been destroyed by the lessor.

The ZEV Mandate originally specified that by 1998, 2% of all new cars
sold by the seven major auto manufacturers in the state of California
were to meet 'zero emission' standards as defined by the [California Air
Resources Board](/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board "wikilink"). While other
manufacturers developed plans to address this mandate, the General
Motors EV1 was the only vehicle which made it to the production phase.

Due to resistance by GM and other manufacturers, industry groups, and by
Western States Petroleum Assn., the ZEV mandate was continually weakened
and compliance standards lowered. In 1999, ex-Governor Gray Davis
appointed Dr. Lloyd, a proponent of Hydrogen Fuel Cells, to head the
California Air Resources Board. The dismantling of the ZEV mandate
accelerated until, in dramatic Board meetings in March and April, 2003,
an "alternative path" was created for auto makers to avoid
battery-powered ZEV vehicles in favor of Fuel Cell (Type III ZEV) and
compliance was back-ended to 2018. Effectively, CARB gave permission for
the auto makers to scrap all the then-existing ZEVs on the road.

EV1 program cancellation
------------------------

In late 2003, GM officially cancelled the EV1 program[1][2] Despite
unfulfilled waiting lists and positive feedback from the lessees, GM
stated that it could not sell enough of the cars to make the EV1
profitable. In fact, during the latter stages of development for the
car, GM officials claimed that they stood no chance of ever making a
profit on the EV1 itself.

Instead, the company hoped that the EV1 would prove their technology and
establish a "leadership" position within the Electric Vehicle market. GM
itself did not expect to turn a profit on electric vehicles for perhaps
10 years after bringing the EV1 to market. The end came when GM decided
it was [cheaper to sue](/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis "wikilink") the State of
California to roll back clean vehicle regulations than it was to build
electric vehicles. GM believed the price of oil would remain low and
people would always want SUVs[3] rather than small electric cars.

GM stated that they spent over $1 billion developing and marketing the
EV1, though a portion of this cost was defrayed by the Clinton
Administration's $1.25 Billion Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles (PNGV) project. [4][5][6] All manufacturers seeking to produce
electric cars for market consumption also benefitted from matching
government funds committed to the [United States Advanced Battery
Consortium](/wiki/United_States_Advanced_Battery_Consortium "wikilink"). The
estimated research and development costs for the EV1 program to
production (prior to marketing and sale costs) was pegged by General
Motors as "slightly less than $500 Million".

When canceling the program, GM also cited a lack of demand for the two
seater, particularly in light of its limited range and its suitability
to "warm weather" states only. During the EV1's development phase,
several Northeastern states moved to pass ZEV laws similar to those
adopted in California. General Motors, along with many other prospective
EV manufacturers, opposed this movement despite the likelihood that such
legislation would have vastly increased the market for the vehicle.
While this may seem a sinister position to have taken (some ardent EV
supporters have claimed that GM sabotaged its own product potential by
taking this step), GM's internal research showed very clearly that the
EV1's already perilously low range would be reduced by as much as 50%
for use in cold-weather states. This was due chiefly to the effect of
ambient temperature on both the batteries performance and the special
low rolling resistance tires.

In 2001, the California Air Resources Board modified the ZEV Mandate[7]
to allow manufacturers to claim partial ZEV credit for [hybrid
vehicles](hybrid_vehicle "wikilink"). General Motors and DaimlerChrysler
then sued the state of California and CARB, alleging that the new ZEV
rules violated a federal law barring states from regulating fuel
economy.[8] In response, CARB removed the requirement for electric
vehicles from the ZEV mandate in 2003, and GM - having produced a
product for a mandate and market that no longer existed - cancelled the
EV1 program soon after.[9]

The last private EV1 lease expired in August of 2004. Upon lease
expiration, the cars were put into storage at a facility in [Burbank,
California](/wiki/Burbank,_California "wikilink"). GM donated a small number
of the returned EV1s to colleges and universities for engineering
students, and to several museums including the [Smithsonian
Institution](/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution "wikilink"). However, most of the
vehicles were quietly destroyed, much to the protest of their former
drivers. By [March 15](/wiki/March_15 "wikilink"), [2005](2005 "wikilink") the
last 78 in storage had been transferred to the [GM Desert Proving
Grounds](/wiki/GM_Desert_Proving_Grounds "wikilink") in [Mesa,
Arizona](/wiki/Mesa,_Arizona "wikilink") for disposal. The EV1s sent to this
site were stripped of their recyclables and crushed.

Over a hundred people offered to purchase the electric cars and waive
such liability as they were able under American consumer product laws.
GM refused, stating that they would be subject to ongoing product
liability from both the purchasers and any future owners, and that their
internal customer support policies would require them to provide service
and replacement parts for the EV1s for at least ten years. [10] GM's
suppliers stopped making replacement parts because of low demand, making
it impossible to repair the vehicles[11]. Of particular concern to the
company was the likelihood that each leased car's battery packs would
require replacement at 25-35,000 mile intervals, and that the very low
volumes involved would necessitate the corporation's subsidy of spare
parts to private owners, perhaps on an indefinite basis. (As an example,
the wholesale, or in house, cost of the battery pack to GM was still in
the $2-3,000 dollar region during the production phase of the EV1
program. Including delivery and installation, GM thought it unlikely an
EV1 could be repowered for less than $6-7000 per unit)

The EV1 has been called a failure by business publications such as the
Wall Street Journal [12] GM believes that the electric car venture was
not a failure, and that the EV1 was doomed when the expected
breakthrough in battery technology did not take place.[13] In fact, the
NiMH battery packs (or [Ovonic](/wiki/Ovonic "wikilink") Battery) that were
expected to dramatically improve range came with their own set of
problems; GM had to use a less-efficient charging algorithm (lengthening
charge times) and waste power on air conditioning to prevent the battery
packs from overheating.[14] In addition, the elimination of the
environmental mandate that lead to the car's creation was, as previously
mentioned, a huge factor in the program's cancellation. The EV1 could
not have been created without the looming CARB 2% ZEV mandate in
California. It is clear that once the mandate was eliminated, the car
would not continue to be produced.

The view of the EV1 as failure is a controversial one in itself. When
viewed as an attempt to produce a commercially viable EV for market
consumption, it seems clear the car did not succeed (the car could not
be produced or maintained at a cost that consumers would have considered
acceptable). If one considers the vehicle from GM's perspective, as a
technological showpiece - a production electric car that actually could
replace a gas powered vehicle - the program's outcome is less clear. The
EV1 was produced for the consumer market, and many lessees found driving
an EV1 to be a favorable experience. On that basis, EV1 would qualify as
the most successful electric car ever built. Some analysts have
suggested that it is inappropriate to compare the EV1 with existing gas
powered commuter cars as the EV1 is, in effect, a completely new product
and had no equivalent vehicles to be judged against. Perhaps the largest
disappointment to consumers is that, having invested the research time
and money to invent the technology required to produce the EV1, GM did
not continue development of future EV designs. Effectively, the
technological advantage GM built through this program was squandered.

It has recently been theorized by the documentary *[Who Killed the
Electric Car?](/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car? "wikilink")* that the EV1
program was eliminated because it posed a threat to the oil industry.
Some still speculate about the role the oil industry played in canceling
the EV1 program, although we will probably never know the real story
behind the cancellation. GM responded to the film's claims, laying out
several reasons why the EV1 was not commercially viable at the time.[15]

Costs
-----

The price for the car used to compute lease payments was $33,995 to
$43,995, which made for lease payments of $299 to over $574 per month.
One industry official said that each EV1 cost the company about $80,000,
including research, development and other associated costs.[16] The
vehicle's lease prices also depended on available state rebates. At the
time of purchase, the cost for the electricity used to power the car was
computed to be 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of the equivalent amount of gasoline
[17], and since that time increases in gas prices may have made
electricity relatively even less expensive (depending on customer
location, recharging time and electricity billing variations (some
utilities have variable billing for peak vs non-peak usage rates)).

Technology
----------

The EV1 was a 'purpose built' electric vehicle, not a conversion of an
existing vehicle or drivetrain. The program was initially administered
by Kenneth Baker, a GM Engineer who had previously managed the
[Electrovette](/wiki/Electrovette "wikilink") program in the
[1970s](1970s "wikilink"). This program had been intended as an
in-factory conversion of the Chevrolet Chevette to electric power, but
did not reach production owing to technical and production cost
difficulties.

General Motors used many advanced technologies in developing the EV1.
These included:

:\*Aluminum frame

:\*Dent resistant side-panels

:\*Anti-lock brakes

:\*Traction control

:\*Heat pump (Heater/AC)

:\*Keyless entry / keyless ignition

:\*Special one-way thermal glass to allow for better heat rejection

:\*Regenerative braking

:\*Very low drag coefficient -
[**C<sub>d</sub>**](/wiki/Drag_Coefficient "wikilink")\~0.19,
[**C<sub>d</sub>A**](/wiki/Drag_Coefficient#CdA "wikilink")\~0.36 m²
(3.95 ft²)

:\*Super light alloy mag wheels

:\*Self sealing & low-rolling resistance tires (developed by
[Michelin](/wiki/Michelin "wikilink"))

:\*Automated tire pressure loss warning system

:\*Magnesium framed seats

:\*Time programmable HVAC (cabin heating or cooling) settings

Most of these technologies were included to improve the overall
efficiency of the EV1.

The first generation EV1s used [lead-acid
batteries](lead-acid_battery "wikilink") in [1996](1996 "wikilink") (as
model year 1997) and a second generation batch with [nickel metal
hydride](nickel_metal_hydride "wikilink") batteries in
[1999](1999 "wikilink"). Some of the Gen 1 EV1s were refurbished and
upgraded to Panasonic Lead Acid batteries.

The Gen 1 cars got 55-to-75 miles (90-to-120 km) per charge with the
Delco-manufactured lead-acid batteries, 75-to-100 miles (120-to-160 km)
with the Gen 2 Panasonic lead-acid batteries, and 75-to-150 miles (120
to 240 km) per charge with Gen 2 Ovonic nickel-metal hydride batteries.
Recharging took as much as eight hours for a full charge (although one
could get an 80% charge in two to three hours). The battery pack
consisted of 26 12-volt lead-acid batteries holding 67.4 MJ (18.7 kWh)
of energy or 26 13.2-volt nickel-metal hydride batteries which held 95.1
MJ (26.4 kWh) of energy.

The EV1 was directly based on a prototype vehicle created by
[AeroVironment](/wiki/AeroVironment "wikilink") called the [GM
Impact](/wiki/GM_Impact "wikilink"). The Impact in turn was based on design
ideas first tested out in a record-breaking race car called the
[Sunraycer](/wiki/Sunraycer "wikilink"), a solar-electric vehicle the company
created in 1987 specifically to win the [Solar
Challenge](/wiki/Solar_Challenge "wikilink"), a trans-Australia race open to
solar powered cars only.

A modified EV1 prototype set a [land speed
record](land_speed_record "wikilink") for production electric vehicles
of 183 mph (295 km/h) in [1994](1994 "wikilink").

Consumer experience
-------------------

The EV1 driving and ownership experience was unlike a conventional
gasoline (petrol) or [diesel](diesel "wikilink") vehicle. The EV1 had
the lowest [aerodynamic drag
coefficient](/wiki/Automotive_aerodynamics "wikilink") of any production
vehicle in history, with a C<sub>d</sub> of 0.195, while typical
production cars have C<sub>d</sub>'s in the 0.3 to 0.4 range.[18] As a
result, at highway speeds, the only audible noise was often the steady
thrum of the tires, with nothing from wind or motors. At lower speeds,
and at stoplights, there was no noise at all, save for a slight whine
from the single-speed gear reduction unit. With its smooth shape and
rear [fender skirts](fender_skirts "wikilink") it had a very distinctive
appearance.

The EV1 could accelerate from 0-60mph in the 8 second range. The car's
top speed was limited to 80 MPH due to gearing that was a design
compromise between low-speed acceleration, vehicle top speed and motor
speed and torque ranges. Vehicle operating information
[instrumentation](instrumentation "wikilink") was displayed by digital
readouts spanning a thin curved strip just under the windshield and well
above the dashboard.

The home charger installation (required for "fast recharge") was about
1.5'x2'x5' with integrated [heatsinks](heatsink "wikilink") and
resembled a gasoline pump. Charging itself was entirely inductive, and
accomplished by placing a [MagneCharge](/wiki/MagneCharge "wikilink") paddle
in the front port of the EV1, although GM also offered a convenience
charger (110/115/120VAC) that could be used in conjunction with any
standard North American receptacle to slow charge the battery pack.

EV1 drivetrain prototypes
-------------------------

[thumb\|right\|EV1 shown plugged into charging
station](image:GM_EV1.jpg "wikilink") General Motors revealed several
prototype variants of the EV1 drivetrain at the [1998](1998 "wikilink")
[Detroit Auto Show](/wiki/Detroit_Auto_Show "wikilink"). The models included
[diesel](/wiki/Diesel_engine "wikilink")/electric [parallel
hybrid](/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle#Parallel "wikilink"), [gas
turbine](gas_turbine "wikilink")/electric [series
hybrid](/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle#Series "wikilink"), [fuel
cell](fuel_cell "wikilink")/electric version and [compressed natural
gas](compressed_natural_gas "wikilink") low emission [internal
combustion engine](internal_combustion_engine "wikilink") version.[19]
In addition, during this period, GM reorganized their electronics
divisions (amongst them Hughes Electronics and Delco Divisions) into
Delco Propulsion Systems in order to attempt to commercialize this
technology in niche markets. Several non-affiliated companies purchased
inverter and drivetrain systems from DPS for vehicle/fleet conversion
purposes.

The new platform was a four-passenger variant of the EV1, lengthened by
19". This design was based on an internal (GM) program for a more
"marketable" EV begun during the proof of concept phase of the EV1's
development. During the original EV1 R&D period, focus groups indicated
one of the major market limiting factors of the original EV1 was it's
two seater configuration. GM investigated the possibility of making the
EV1 a four seater, but ultimately determined that the increased length
and weight of the four seater would reduce vehicle's already limited
range to 40-50 miles - placing the first ground up electric car's
performance squarely in the pack of aftermarket gas vehicle conversions.
Understandably, the company elected to produce the lighter two seater
design.

For hybrid and electric vehicles, the battery pack was upgraded to 44
[NiMH](/wiki/NiMH "wikilink") cells, arranged in "I" formation down the
centerline, which could fully recharge in just 2 hours using onboard
220 V induction charger; additional power units were installed in the
trunk, thus complementing the 3rd generation 137 hp AC Induction
electric motor installed in the hood. Hybrid modifications retained the
capability of all-electric [ZEV](/wiki/ZEV "wikilink") propulsion for up to 40
miles (64.4 km).

### EV1 CNG

The CNG variant was the only non-electric vehicle in the line-up, even
though it employed the same up-stretched platform. It used a modified
[Suzuki](/wiki/Suzuki "wikilink") 1.0-liter [turbocharged](turbo "wikilink")
3-cylinder all-aluminum [OHC](/wiki/OHC "wikilink") engine installed under the
hood. Due to the high octane rating of the CNG (allowing for a greater
[compression ratio](compression_ratio "wikilink")), this small engine
was able to deliver 72hp at 5500 rpm.

The batteries were replaced with two CNG tanks capable of maximum
operating pressure of 3000psi. The tanks could be refueled from a single
nozzle in only 4 minutes. In-tank solenoids shut off the fuel during
refueling and engine idle, and a pressure relief device safeguarded
against excessive temperature and pressure. With the help of
[continuously variable
transmission](continuously_variable_transmission "wikilink"), the car
accelerated 0 to 60 mph (96.6 km/h) in 11 seconds. The maximum range was
350 to 400 miles, and fuel economy was 60mpg (in
[gasoline](gasoline "wikilink") equivalent).

### EV1 series hybrid

<img src="GMEV1serieshybrid.jpg" title="fig:EV1 series hybrid prototype at EVS-16 in Beijing, 1999" alt="EV1 series hybrid prototype at EVS-16 in Beijing, 1999" width="200" />
The series hybrid prototype had a gas turbine engine
[APU](/wiki/Auxiliary_power_unit "wikilink") placed in the trunk. A
single-stage, single-shaft, [recuperated](/wiki/Recuperator "wikilink") gas
turbine unit with a high-speed permanent-magnet AC generator was
provided by [Williams International](/wiki/Williams_International "wikilink");
it weighed 220 lb (99.8 kg), measured 20 inches (50.8 cm) in diameter by
22 inches (55.9 cm) long and was running between 100,000 and 140,000
rpm. The turbine could run on multiple fuels, from [reformulated
gasoline](/wiki/Gasoline#Oxygenate_blending "wikilink") to [compressed natural
gas](compressed_natural_gas "wikilink"). The APU started automatically
when the battery charge dropped below 40% and delivered 40 kW of
electrical power, enough to achieve speeds up to 80 mph (128.8 km/h) and
to return the car's 44 [NiMH](/wiki/NiMH "wikilink") cells to a 50% charge
level.

A fuel tank capacity of 6.5 gallons (24.6 l) and fuel economy of 60 to
100 mpg (3.9 to 2.4 L/100 km) in hybrid mode, depending on the driving
conditions, allowed for a highway range of more than 390 miles (627.6
km). The car accelerated to 0-60 mph (96.6 km/h) in 9 seconds.

### EV1 parallel hybrid

The parallel hybrid variant featured 1.3 L
[turbocharged](turbocharged "wikilink") DTI diesel engine from
[Isuzu](/wiki/Isuzu "wikilink") delivering 75 hp, installed in the trunk along
with an additional 6.5 hp DC motor/generator; the two motors drove the
rear wheels through an electronically controlled transaxle. When
combined with the AC induction motor which powered the front wheels, all
three power units delivered a total output of 219 hp, accelerating the
car to 0-60 mph (96.6 km/h) in 7 seconds. A single tank of diesel fuel
could keep the car running for 550 miles with a fuel economy of 80 mpg.

A similar technology is used in the 2005 *[Opel
Astra](/wiki/Opel_Astra "wikilink") Diesel Hybrid* concept.

### EV1 fuel cell

This variant extended all-electric propulsion capabilities with a
methanol-powered fuel cell system (developed by
[Daimler-Benz](/wiki/Daimler-Benz "wikilink")/[Ballard](Ballard_Power_Systems "wikilink")
for the [Mercedes-Benz NECAR](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_NECAR "wikilink")), again
installed in the trunk. The system consisted of a fuel processor, an
expander/compressor and the fuel cell stack. The highway range was about
300 miles, with a fuel economy of 80 mpg (in a gasoline equivalent). The
car accelerated to 0-60 mph (96.6 km/h) in 9 seconds.

Controversy
-----------

![EV1s crushed by [General
Motors](/wiki/General_Motors "wikilink")\|300px](evcrushed.jpg "fig:EV1s crushed by General Motors|300px")
Many consumers and government officials questioned General Motors'
commitment to the EV1 program. Concerns over inadequate marketing and
limited vehicle supply have led some to believe the EV1 program was
intended to fail, and by doing so to prove that electric vehicles were
not commercially viable with the then current level of technology.
General Motors position on this was very clear - they spent $500 million
trying to produce a workable electric vehicle that could compete and win
"heads up" in the marketplace. If the company could have recouped their
investment by selling the vehicles commercially, they said, they
certainly would have done so. In the hearts of ardent EV supporters,
continuing doubts linger about motives, however.

The process of obtaining an EV1 was difficult when compared to the
purchase of any other commuter car. The vehicle could not be purchased
outright. Instead, General Motors offered a closed-end lease for three
years, with no renewal or residual purchase option. The EV1 was only
available from Saturn dealerships (then less prevalent than they are
today), and only in California and Arizona (for technical reasons).

Before reviewing leasing options, a potential lessee would be taken
through a 'pre-qualification' process in order to learn how the EV1 was
different from other vehicles (a similar 'buyer familiarization process'
was standard for all Saturn buyers). Following this, prospective lessees
would be placed on a waiting list with no scheduled delivery date. After
an average wait of between two and six months, the lessee would be
allotted a vehicle. Installation of a home charger took one to two weeks
and cost an additional $2500 (on average).

Ardent supporters of electric vehicles have been very vocal about the
program's demise. Of particular interest is the leasing program which
formally required the vehicles to be returned to GM at lease expiry.
General Motors stated reason for the lease-only basis was that, as the
modern era's first ground up electric vehicle, the EV1 could not be
expected to maintain its performance level (or affordability in regard
to maintenance) over the long run. GM also had significant concerns over
long term liability issues relating to the vehicle. This was partly due
to the relatively short R&D period the car was designed and produced
under, and the high percentage of "invented on schedule" technology
employed in the car as compared with a standard gas powered vehicle.
While many lessees and prospective owners have complained about the
lease-only availability of the EV1, it is important to note that each
leased vehicle was in effect heavily subsidized by General Motors. The
car was very popular with its lessees, but it is not known if anyone
would have purchased the vehicle had it been offered for sale even at a
"break even" price of $35-40,000 USD.

According to GM Chairman and CEO [Rick
Wagoner](/wiki/Rick_Wagoner "wikilink"), the worst decision of his tenure at
GM was "axing the EV1 electric-car program and not putting the right
resources into hybrids. It didn’t affect profitability, but it did
affect image."[20] According to the March 13, 2007 issue of *Newsweek*,
"GM R&D chief Larry Burns . . . now wishes GM hadn't killed the plug-in
hybrid EV1 prototype his engineers had on the road a decade ago: 'If we
could turn back the hands of time,' says Burns, 'we could have had the
Chevy Volt 10 years earlier.'" [21]

A documentary about the demise of the EV1 and other electric vehicles
entitled *[Who Killed the Electric
Car?](/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car? "wikilink")* debuted on [June
30](/wiki/June_30 "wikilink"), [2006](2006 "wikilink"). Several weeks before
the debut of the movie, the Smithsonian Institution announced that its
EV1 display was being permanently removed and the EV1 car put into
storage. Although GM is a major financial contributor to the museum,
both parties denied that this fact contributed to the removal of the
display.[22] According to the museum, the removal of the EV1 from
display was a necessary aspect of its renovation.[23] The space where
the EV1 stood has been filled by
[Stanley](/wiki/Stanley_(vehicle) "wikilink"), an unmanned [Volkswagen
Touareg](/wiki/Volkswagen_Touareg "wikilink")
[SUV](sport_utility_vehicle "wikilink").[24] An EV1 is still on display
at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

[16]  That would put GM's total investment at $89 Million, as 1115 cars
were produced.

[17] Fuel costs can be estimated as follows: This article states the
nickel-metal hydride batteries held 26.4 kWh of energy. According to the
Wikipedia article on [Electricity
retailing](/wiki/Electricity_retailing "wikilink") the average cost of
electricity is approximately $.106 per kWh. Therefore it would cost 26.4
x $.106 or $2.80 to fully charge the batteries, neglecting any losses in
the charging system. The range of the vehicle was 75-150 miles, so it
could travel approximately 100 miles at an electric cost of $2.80. If
gasoline costs $2 / gallon and a similar car gets 30 miles / gallon then
gasoline fuel costs are $6.67 to travel 100 miles. The electric "fuel
cost" is approximately 41% of the gasoline fuel cost in this example.
