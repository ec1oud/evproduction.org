A '''battery pack''' is a set of any number of (preferably) identical [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] or individual battery cells.  They may be configured in a series, parallel or a mixture of both to deliver the desired voltage, capacity, or power density. The term battery pack is often used in reference to RC hobby toys and [[battery electric vehicle]]s.

Components of battery packs include the individual batteries or cells, and the [[interconnects]] which provide electrical conductivity between them.  Interconnects are also found in batteries as they are the part which connects each cell, though batteries are most often only arranged in series strings.  When wiring a pack in parallel there are various methods and one should take into consideration the ''balance'' of the electrical circuit. [[Battery regulator]]s are sometimes used to keep the peak voltage of each individual battery or cell below its maximum value so to allow weaker batteries to be fully charged, bringing the whole pack back into balance. Active balancing can also be performed by [[battery balancer]] devices which can shuttle energy from strong batteries to weaker ones in real time for even better balance.  A well-balanced pack lasts longer and delivers better performance so it is a rather beneficial component of high capacity or expensive packs.

For an inline package cells are selected and stacked with solder in between and pressed together and a current pulse is used to generate heat and solder them together and to weld all connections internal the cell.

==Calculating State Of Charge==
SOC or State of charge is the equivalent of a [[fuel gauge]] for a battery.  SOC is sometimes difficult to determine as it can not usually be determined by simple voltage measurements.  Electrolite PH levels are a good SOC indication, but many modern chemistries don't offer easy access to that part of the battery.  Most SOC methods take into account voltage and current as well as temperature and other aspects of the discharge and charge process to in essence count up or down within a pre-defined capacity of a pack.  E-Meters take into account Puckert effect which is a function of charge/discharge rate or amps.

==Advantages==
An advantage of a battery pack is the ease with which it can be swapped into or out of a device. This allows multiple packs to deliver extended runtimes, freeing up the device for continued use while charging the removed pack separately.

Another advantage is the flexibility of their design and implementation, allowing for the use of cheaper high production cells or batteries to be combined into a pack for nearly any application.

==Disadvantages==
Packs are often simpler for end users to repair or tamper with than a sealed non-serviceable battery or cell.  Though some might consider this an advantage it is important to take safety precautions when servicing a battery pack as they pose a danger as potential chemical, electrical, and fire risks.

==Use in science fiction==
In science fiction and video games, a battery pack is sometimes called a '''power pack''', and is used for energy weapons and other devices. Usually these packs have an extraordinarly high energy density, well beyond any current technologies.
