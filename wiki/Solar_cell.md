A **solar cell** or **[photovoltaic](/wiki/Photovoltaics "wikilink") cell** is
a device that converts [light](light "wikilink")
[energy](energy "wikilink") into [electrical](electricity "wikilink")
energy. Sometimes the term *solar cell* is reserved for devices intended
specifically to capture energy from sunlight, while the term
*photovoltaic cell* is used when the light source is unspecified.

Fundamentally, the device needs to fulfill only two functions:
photogeneration of charge carriers ([electrons](electron "wikilink") and
[holes](electron_hole "wikilink")) in a [light-absorbing
material](/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation) "wikilink"), and
separation of the charge carriers to a conductive contact that will
transmit the electricity (simply put, carrying electrons off through a
metal contact into a wire or other circuit). This conversion is called
the *photovoltaic effect*, and the field of research related to solar
cells is known as [photovoltaics](photovoltaics "wikilink").

Solar cells have many applications. They have long been used in
situations where electrical power from the
[grid](/wiki/Electric_power_transmission "wikilink") is unavailable, such as
in remote area power systems, [Earth](/wiki/Earth "wikilink")-orbiting
[satellites](satellites "wikilink") and space probes, consumer systems,
e.g. handheld [calculators](calculators "wikilink") or wrist watches,
remote [radiotelephones](radiotelephone "wikilink") and
[water](water "wikilink") pumping applications. More recently, they are
starting to be used in assemblies of solar modules ([photovoltaic
arrays](photovoltaic_array "wikilink")) connected to the [electricity
grid](electricity_grid "wikilink") through an
[inverter](inverter_(electrical) "wikilink"), often in combination with
a [net metering](net_metering "wikilink") arrangement.

Solar cells are regarded as one of the key technologies towards a
sustainable energy supply.

Four generations of development
-------------------------------

### First

The **first generation photovoltaic**, consists of a large-area, single
layer [p-n junction](p-n_junction "wikilink") [diode](diode "wikilink"),
which is capable of generating usable
[electrical](electrical "wikilink") [energy](energy "wikilink") from
light sources with the [wavelengths](wavelength "wikilink") of sunlight.
These cells are typically made using a [silicon](silicon "wikilink")
wafer. First generation photovoltaic cells (also known as silicon
wafer-based solar cells) are the dominant technology in the commercial
production of solar cells, accounting for more than 86% of the solar
cell market.

### Second

The **second generation** of photovoltaic materials is based on the use
of thin-film deposits of semiconductors. These devices were initially
designed to be high-efficiency, multiple junction photovoltaic cells.
Later, the advantage of using a thin-film of material was noted,
reducing the mass of material required for cell design. This contributed
to a prediction of greatly reduced costs for thin film solar cells.
Currently (2007) there are different technologies/semiconductor
materials under investigation or in mass production, such as amorphous
silicon, poly-crystalline silicon, micro-crystalline silicon, cadmium
telluride, copper indium selenide/sulfide. Typically, the efficiencies
of thin-film solar cells are lower compared with silicon (wafer-based)
solar cells, but manufacturing costs are also lower, so that a lower
cost per watt can be achieved. Another advantage of the reduced mass is
that less support is needed when placing panels on rooftops and it
allows fitting panels on light materials or flexible materials, even
textiles.

### Third

**Third generation** photovoltaics are very different from the other
two, broadly defined as semiconductor devices which do not rely on a
traditional p-n junction to separate photogenerated charge carriers.
These new devices include [photoelectrochemical
cells](photoelectrochemical_cell "wikilink"), [Polymer solar
cells](/wiki/Polymer_solar_cell "wikilink"), and [nanocrystal solar
cells](nanocrystal_solar_cell "wikilink").

### Fourth

**Fourth generation** Composite photovoltaic technology with the use of
polymers with nano particles can be mixed together to make a single
multispectrum layer. Then the thin multi spectrum layers can be stacked
to make multispectrum solar cells more efficient and cheaper based on
polymer solar cell and multi junction technology by NASA used on Mars
missions. The layer that converts different types of light is first then
another layer for the light that passes and last is an infra-red
spectrum layer for the cell thus converting some of the heat for an
overall solar cell composite.

Companies working on third generation photovoltaics include Xsunx,
[Konarka Technologies, Inc.](/wiki/Konarka_Technologies,_Inc. "wikilink"),
[Nanosolar](/wiki/Nanosolar "wikilink") and [Nanosys](Nanosys "wikilink").
Research is also being done in this area by the [USA](/wiki/USA "wikilink")'s
[National Renewable Energy
Laboratory](/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory "wikilink")
(http://www.nrel.gov/).

History
-------

The term "photovoltaic" comes from the
[Greek](/wiki/Greek_language "wikilink") φώς:*phos* meaning "light", and the
name of the [Italian](/wiki/Italian_people "wikilink") physicist
[Volta](/wiki/Alessandro_Volta "wikilink"), after whom the measurement unit
[volts](volts "wikilink") are named. It means literally *of light and
electricity*.

The photovoltaic effect was first recognised in [1839](1839 "wikilink")
by French physicist [Alexandre-Edmond
Becquerel](/wiki/A._E._Becquerel "wikilink"). However, it was not until
[1883](1883 "wikilink") that the first solar cell was built, by [Charles
Fritts](/wiki/Charles_Fritts "wikilink"), who coated the
[semiconductor](semiconductor "wikilink")
[selenium](selenium "wikilink") with an extremely thin layer of
[gold](gold "wikilink") to form the junctions. The device was only
around 1% efficient. [Russell Ohl](/wiki/Russell_Ohl "wikilink") patented the
modern solar cell in 1946 (, "*Light sensitive device*"). Sven Ason
Berglund had a prior patent concerning methods of increasing the
capacity of photosensitive cells. The modern age of solar power
technology arrived in 1954 when Bell Laboratories, experimenting with
semiconductors, accidentally found that silicon doped with certain
impurities was very sensitive to light.

This resulted in the production of the first practical solar cells with
a sunlight energy conversion efficiency of around 6 percent. This
milestone created interest in producing and launching a
[geostationary](geostationary "wikilink") communications
[satellite](satellite "wikilink") by providing a viable power supply.
Russia launched the first artificial satellite in 1957, and the United
States' first artificial satellite was launched in 1958. Russian
[Sputnik 3](/wiki/Sputnik_3 "wikilink") ("Satellite-3"), launched on [15
May](15_May "wikilink"), [1958](1958 "wikilink"), was the first
satellite to use solar arrays. This was a crucial development which
diverted funding from several governments into research for improved
solar cells.

Applications and implementations
--------------------------------

![Polycrystaline PV cells laminated to backing material in a PV
module](Polycristalline-silicon-wafer_20060626_568.jpg "fig:Polycrystaline PV cells laminated to backing material in a PV module")
![Polycrystalline PV
cells](Solar_panel.png "fig:Polycrystalline PV cells") Solar cells are
often electrically connected and encapsulated as a **module**. PV
modules often have a sheet of glass on the front (sun up) side ,
allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor
[wafers](/wiki/Wafer_(electronics) "wikilink") from the elements
([rain](rain "wikilink"), [hail](hail "wikilink"), etc.). Solar cells
are also usually connected in
[series](series_and_parallel_circuits "wikilink") in modules, creating
an additive [voltage](voltage "wikilink"). Connecting cells in parallel
will yield a higher current. Modules are then interconnected, in series
or parallel, or both, to create an **array** with the desired peak DC
voltage and current.

The power output of a solar array is given in [watts](watts "wikilink")
or [kilowatts](kilowatts "wikilink"). In order to calculate the typical
energy needs of the application, a measurement in watt-hours,
[kilowatt-hours](kilowatt-hours "wikilink") or kilowatt-hours per day is
often used.

Theory
------

### Simple explanation

1.  [Photons](/wiki/Photon "wikilink") in [sunlight](sunlight "wikilink") hit
    the solar panel and are absorbed by semiconducting materials, such
    as [silicon](silicon "wikilink").
2.  [Electrons](/wiki/Electrons "wikilink") (negatively charged) are knocked
    loose from their atoms, allowing them to flow through the material
    to produce [electricity](electricity "wikilink"). The complementary
    positive charges that are also created (like bubbles) are called
    [holes](electron_hole "wikilink") and flow in the direction opposite
    of the electrons in a silicon solar panel.
3.  An array of solar panels converts solar energy into a usable amount
    of [direct current](direct_current "wikilink") (DC) electricity.

Optionally:

1.  The DC current enters an
    [inverter](inverter_(electrical) "wikilink").
2.  The inverter turns DC electricity into 120 or 240-volt AC
    (alternating current) electricity needed for home appliances.
3.  The AC power enters the utility panel in the house.
4.  The electricity is then distributed to appliances or lights in the
    house.
5.  The electricity that is not used will be recycled and reused in
    other facilities.

### Photogeneration of charge carriers

When a [photon](photon "wikilink") hits a piece of silicon, one of three
things can happen:

1.  the photon can pass straight through the silicon — this (generally)
    happens for lower energy photons,
2.  the photon can reflect off the surface,
3.  the photon can be absorbed by the silicon which either:
    -   Generates heat, OR
    -   Generates electron-hole pairs, if the photon energy is higher
        than the silicon [band gap](band_gap "wikilink") value.

Note that if a photon has *an integer multiple* of band gap energy, it
can create more than one electron-hole pair. However, this effect is
usually not significant in solar cells. The "integer multiple" part is a
result of [quantum mechanics](quantum_mechanics "wikilink") and the
quantization of energy.

When a photon is absorbed, its energy is given to an electron in the
crystal lattice. Usually this electron is in the [valence
band](valence_band "wikilink"), and is tightly bound in covalent bonds
between neighboring atoms, and hence unable to move far. The energy
given to it by the photon "excites" it into the [conduction
band](conduction_band "wikilink"), where it is free to move around
within the semiconductor. The covalent bond that the electron was
previously a part of now has one fewer electron — this is known as a
hole. The presence of a missing covalent bond allows the bonded
electrons of neighboring atoms to move into the "hole," leaving another
hole behind, and in this way a hole can move through the lattice. Thus,
it can be said that photons absorbed in the semiconductor create mobile
electron-hole pairs.

A photon need only have greater energy than that of the band gap in
order to excite an electron from the valence band into the conduction
band. However, the solar [frequency
spectrum](frequency_spectrum "wikilink") approximates a [black
body](black_body "wikilink") spectrum at \~6000 K, and as such, much of
the solar radiation reaching the [Earth](/wiki/Earth "wikilink") is composed
of photons with energies greater than the band gap of silicon. These
higher energy photons will be absorbed by the solar cell, but the
difference in energy between these photons and the silicon band gap is
converted into heat (via lattice vibrations — called
[phonons](phonons "wikilink")) rather than into usable electrical
energy.

### Charge carrier separation

There are two main modes for charge carrier separation in a solar cell:

1.  **drift** of carriers, driven by an electrostatic field established
    across the device
2.  **diffusion** of carriers from zones of high carrier concentration
    to zones of low carrier concentration (following a gradient of
    electrochemical potential).

In the widely used *p-n junction* designed solar cells, the dominant
mode of charge carrier separation is by *drift*. However, in *non-p-n
junction* designed solar cells (typical of the third generation of solar
cell research such as dye and polymer thin-film solar cells), a general
electrostatic field has been confirmed to be absent, and the dominant
mode of separation is via charge carrier *diffusion*.

### The p-n junction

` `

The most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area [p-n
junction](p-n_junction "wikilink") made from silicon. As a
simplification, one can imagine bringing a layer of n-type silicon into
direct contact with a layer of p-type silicon. In practice, p-n
junctions of silicon solar cells are not made in this way, but rather,
by diffusing an n-type dopant into one side of a p-type wafer (or vice
versa).

If a piece of p-type silicon is placed in intimate contact with a piece
of n-type silicon, then a [diffusion](diffusion "wikilink") of electrons
occurs from the region of high electron concentration (the n-type side
of the junction) into the region of low electron concentration (p-type
side of the junction). When the electrons diffuse across the p-n
junction, they recombine with holes on the p-type side. The diffusion of
carriers does not happen indefinitely however, because of an [electric
field](electric_field "wikilink") which is created by the imbalance of
charge immediately either side of the junction which this diffusion
creates. The electric field established across the p-n junction creates
a [diode](diode "wikilink") that promotes
[current](current_(electricity) "wikilink") to flow in only one
direction across the junction. Electrons may pass from the n-type side
into the p-type side, and holes may pass from the p-type side to the
n-type side. This region where electrons have diffused across the
junction is called the [depletion region](depletion_zone "wikilink")
because it no longer contains any mobile charge carriers. It is also
known as the "space charge region".

### Connection to an external load

Ohmic [metal](metal "wikilink")-semiconductor contacts are made to both
the n-type and p-type sides of the solar cell, and the electrodes
connected to an external load. Electrons that are created on the n-type
side, or have been "collected" by the junction and swept onto the n-type
side, may travel through the wire, power the load, and continue through
the wire until they reach the p-type semiconductor-metal contact. Here,
they recombine with a hole that was either created as an electron-hole
pair on the p-type side of the solar cell, or swept across the junction
from the n-type side after being created there.

### Equivalent circuit of a solar cell

<img src="Solar_cell_equivalent_circuit.png" title="fig:The equivalent circuit of a solar cell" alt="The equivalent circuit of a solar cell" width="180" />
<img src="Photovoltaic_cell.svg" title="fig:The schematic symbol of a solar cell" alt="The schematic symbol of a solar cell" width="100" />

To understand the electronic behavior of a solar cell, it is useful to
create a [model](model_(physical) "wikilink") which is electrically
equivalent, and is based on discrete electrical components whose
behaviour is well known. An ideal solar cell may be modelled by a
current source in parallel with a [diode](diode "wikilink"). In practice
no solar cell is ideal, so a shunt resistance and a series resistance
component are added to the model. The result is the "equivalent circuit
of a solar cell" shown on the left. Also shown on the right, is the
schematic representation of a solar cell for use in circuit diagrams.

Solar cell efficiency factors
-----------------------------

### Maximum-power point

A solar cell may operate over a wide range of
[voltages](voltage "wikilink") (V) and
[currents](current_(electricity) "wikilink") (I). By increasing the
resistive load on an irradiated cell continuously from zero (a *[short
circuit](short_circuit "wikilink")*) to a very high value (an *[open
circuit](open_circuit "wikilink")*) one can determine the
[maximum-power](maximum_power_theorem "wikilink") point, that is, the
load for which the cell can deliver maximum electrical power at that
level of irradiation. V<sub>m</sub> x I<sub>m</sub> = P<sub>m</sub> in
[watts](watts "wikilink").

The quickest way to determine the optimal load for a given constant
light condition is to measure the [Thevenin
Voltage](/wiki/Thevenin_Voltage "wikilink") (i.e. open circuit), then use a
[potentiometer](potentiometer "wikilink") as a load, monitoring the
voltage across it as the pot is dialed. When the load voltage is exactly
half of the [Thevenin Voltage](/wiki/Thevenin_Voltage "wikilink"), disconnect
the [potentiometer](potentiometer "wikilink") and measure its resistance
on an ohmmeter. By definition, the
[potentiometer](potentiometer "wikilink")'s resistance will be the
optimal value of the load for maximum power transfer (due to the equal
voltage division between internal [Thevenin
Resistance](/wiki/Thevenin_Resistance "wikilink") and the load).

The maximum power point of a photovoltaic varies with incident
illumination. For systems large enough to justify the extra expense
(say, \~1kW - ref?), a [power point
tracker](power_point_tracker "wikilink") tracks the instantaneous power
by continually measuring the voltage and current (and hence, power
transfer), and uses this to dynamically adjust the load so the maximum
power is <i>always</i> tranfered, regardless of the variation in
lighting.

### Energy conversion efficiency

A solar cell's *energy conversion efficiency* (*η*, "eta"), is the
percentage of power converted (from absorbed light to electrical energy)
and collected, when a solar cell is connected to an electrical circuit.
This term is calculated using the ratio of *P<sub>m</sub>*, divided by
the input light *[irradiance](irradiance "wikilink")* under "standard"
test conditions (*E*, in W/m<sup>2</sup>) and the *surface area* of the
solar cell (*A<sub>c</sub>* in m²).

$$\\eta = \\frac{P\_{m}}{E \\times A\_c}$$

At solar noon on a clear March or September
[equinox](equinox "wikilink") day, the solar radiation at the equator is
about 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Hence, the "standard" solar radiation (known
as the "air mass 1.5 spectrum") has a power density of 1000
[watts](watt "wikilink") per square [meter](meter "wikilink"). Thus, a
12% efficiency solar cell having 1 m² of surface area in full sunlight
at solar noon at the equator during either the March or September
[equinox](equinox "wikilink") will produce approximately 120 watts of
peak power.

### Fill factor

Another defining term in the overall behavior of a solar cell is the
*[fill factor](fill_factor "wikilink")* (*FF*). This is the ratio of the
*maximum power point* divided by the *open circuit voltage*
(*V<sub>oc</sub>*) and the *short circuit current* (*I<sub>sc</sub>*):

$$FF = \\frac{P\_{m}}{V\_{oc} \\times I\_{sc}} = \\frac{\\eta \\times A\_c \\times E}{V\_{oc} \\times I\_{sc}}$$

### Quantum efficiency

*[Quantum efficiency](/wiki/Quantum_efficiency "wikilink")* refers to the
percentage of *absorbed photons* that produce *electron-hole pairs* (or
*charge carriers*). This is a term intrinsic to the *light absorbing
material*, and not the cell as a whole (which becomes more relevant for
*thin-film* solar cells). This term should not be confused with **energy
[conversion](conversion "wikilink") efficiency**, as it does not convey
information about the power collected from the solar cell.

### Comparison of energy conversion efficiencies

`  `

Solar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar
cells to 40.7% with multiple-junction research lab cells. Solar cell
energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available *mc-Si* solar
cells are around 14-16%. The highest efficiency cells have not always
been the most economical — for example a 30% efficient multijunction
cell based on exotic materials such as gallium arsenide or indium
selenide and produced in low volume might well cost *one hundred times*
as much as an 8% efficient amorphous silicon cell in mass production,
while only delivering about *four times* the electrical power.

To make practical use of the solar-generated energy, the electricity is
most often fed into the electricity grid using inverters (grid-connected
PV systems); in stand alone systems, batteries are used to store the
energy that is not needed immediately.

A common method used to express economic costs of electricity-generating
systems is to calculate a price per delivered
[kilowatt-hour](kilowatt-hour "wikilink") (kWh). The solar cell
efficiency in combination with the available irradiation has a major
influence on the costs, but generally speaking the overall system
efficiency is important. Using the commercially available solar cells
(as of 2006) and system technology leads to system efficiencies between
5 and 19%. As of 2005, photovoltaic electricity generation costs ranged
from \~0.60 US$/kWh (0.50 €/kWh) (central Europe) down to \~0.30 US$/kWh
(0.25 €/kWh) in regions of high solar irradiation. This electricity is
generally fed into the electrical grid on the customer's side of the
meter. The cost can be compared to prevailing [retail electric
pricing](retail_electric_pricing "wikilink") (as of 2005), which varied
from between 0.04 and 0.50 US$/kWh worldwide. (Note: in addition to
solar irradiance profiles, these costs/kwh calculations will vary
depending on assumptions for years of useful life of a system. Most c-Si
panels are warrantied for 25 years and should see 35+ years of useful
life.)

The chart at the right illustrates the various commercial large-area
module energy conversion efficiencies and the best laboratory
efficiencies obtained for various materials and technologies.
![700x\|right\|\| Reported timeline of solar cell energy conversion
efficiencies (from National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(USA)](Nrel_best_research_pv_cell_efficiencies.png "fig:700x|right|| Reported timeline of solar cell energy conversion efficiencies (from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (USA)")

#### Peak watt (or watt peak)

Since solar cell output power depends on multiple factors, such as the
[sun](sun "wikilink")'s [incidence angle](incidence_angle "wikilink"),
for comparison purposes between different cells and panels, the peak
watt (Wp) is used. It is the output power under these conditions:[1]

1.  [solar irradiance](solar_irradiance "wikilink") 1000 W/m²
2.  solar [reference spectrum](reference_spectrum "wikilink") AM
    ([airmass](airmass "wikilink")) 1.5
3.  cell temperature 25[°C](°C "wikilink")

#### Solar cells and energy payback

There is controversy over whether solar cells produce more energy than
it takes to make them. The energy payback time of a solar panel,
assuming a working lifetime of around 40 years, is anywhere from 1 to 20
years (usually under five)[2] depending on the type and where it is used
(see net energy gain). This means solar cells can be net energy
producers meaning they generate more energy over their lifetime than the
energy expended in producing them.[3][4]

Whether solar cells generate positive net energy is disputed by some
researchers who object that such analysis doesn't take into account
waste, inefficiency, and related energy costs that would come with a
real-world solar cell.[5]

Light-absorbing materials
-------------------------

All solar cells require a *[light absorbing
material](/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation) "wikilink")* contained
within the cell structure to absorb photons and generate electrons via
the *[photovoltaic effect](/wiki/Photovoltaics "wikilink")*. The materials
used in solar cells tend to have the property of preferentially
absorbing the wavelengths of solar light that reach the earth surface;
however, some solar cells are optimized for light absorption beyond
Earth's atmosphere as well. Light absorbing materials can often be used
in *multiple physical configurations* to take advantage of different
light absorption and charge separation mechanisms (listed in
alphabetical order). Many currently available solar cells are configured
as **bulk** materials that are subsequently cut into wafers and treated
in a "top-down" method of synthesis (silicon being the most prevalent
bulk material). Other materials are configured as **thin-films**
(inorganic layers, organic dyes, and organic polymers) that are
deposited on **supporting substrates**, while a third group are used as
**quantum dots** (electron-confined nanoparticles) embedded in a
supporting matrix in a "bottom-up" approach. Silicon remains the only
material that is well-researched in both *bulk* and *thin-film*
configurations.

### Bulk

These *bulk* technologies are often referred to as wafer-based
manufacturing. In other words, in each of these approaches,
self-supporting wafers between 180 to 240 micrometers thick are
processed and then soldered together to form a solar cell module. A
general description of silicon wafer processing is provided in
*Manufacture and Devices*.

#### Silicon

By far, the most prevalent *bulk* material for solar cells is
[crystalline](crystalline "wikilink") [silicon](silicon "wikilink")
(abbreviated as a group as *c-Si*), also known as "solar grade silicon".
Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to
crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting
[ingot](ingot "wikilink"), [ribbon](ribbon "wikilink"), or
[wafer](wafer "wikilink").

1.  *monocrystalline silicon* (c-Si): often made using the [Czochralski
    process](/wiki/Czochralski_process "wikilink"). Single-crystal wafer cells
    tend to be expensive, and because they are cut from cylindrical
    ingots, do not completely cover a square solar cell module without a
    substantial waste of refined silicon. Hence most *c-Si* panels have
    uncovered gaps at the corners of four cells.
2.  *Poly- or multicrystalline silicon* (poly-Si or mc-Si): made from
    cast square ingots — large blocks of molten silicon carefully cooled
    and solidified. These cells are less expensive to produce than
    single crystal cells but are less efficient.
3.  *Ribbon silicon*: formed by drawing flat thin films from molten
    silicon and having a multicrystalline structure. These cells have
    lower efficiencies than poly-Si, but save on production costs due to
    a great reduction in silicon waste, as this approach does not
    require sawing from ingots.
4.  *New Structures*: These new compounds are special arrangements of
    silicon that can dramatically improve efficiency such as
    [ormosil](ormosil "wikilink").

### Thin films

The various *thin-film* technologies currently being developed reduce
the amount (or mass) of **light absorbing material** required in
creating a *solar cell*. This can lead to reduced processing costs from
that of bulk materials (in the case of silicon thin films) but also
tends to reduce *energy conversion efficiency*, although many
multi-layer thin films have efficiencies above those of bulk silicon
wafers.

#### CdTe

[Cadmium telluride](/wiki/Cadmium_telluride "wikilink") is an efficient
light-absorbing material for thin-film solar cells. Compared to other
thin-film materials, CdTe is easier to deposit and more suitable for
large-scale production. Despite much discussion of the toxicity of
CdTe-based solar cells, this is the only technology (apart from
amorphous silicon) that can be delivered on a large scale, as shown by
First Solar and Antec Solar. There is a 40 megawatt plant in Ohio (USA)
and a 10 megawatt plant in Germany. First Solar is scaling up to a 100
MW plant in Germany and started building another 100 MW plant in
Malaysia (2007).

The perception of the toxicity of CdTe is based on the toxicity of
elemental [cadmium](cadmium "wikilink"), a heavy metal that is a
[cumulative poison](cumulative_poison "wikilink"). Scientific work,
particularly by researchers of the National Renewable Energy
Laboratories (NREL) in the USA, has shown that the release of cadmium to
the atmosphere is lower with CdTe-based solar cells than with silicon
photovoltaics and other thin-film solar cell technologies.

#### CIGS

CIGS are multi-layered thin-film composites. The abbreviation stands for
[copper indium gallium
selenide](copper_indium_gallium_selenide "wikilink"). Unlike the basic
silicon solar cell, which can be modelled as a simple p-n junction (see
under [semiconductor](semiconductor "wikilink")), these cells are best
described by a more complex heterojunction model. The best efficiency of
a thin-film solar cell as of December 2005 was 19.5% with CIGS. Higher
efficiencies (around 30%) can be obtained by using optics to concentrate
the incident light. The use of gallium increases the bandgap of the CIGS
layer as compare to CIS thus increase the voltage. In another point of
view, gallium is added to replace as much indium as possible due to
gallium's relative availability to indium. Approximately 70%[6] of
Indium currently produced is used by the flat-screen monitor industry.
Some investors in solar technology worry that production of CIGS cells
will be limited by the availability of indium. Producing 2 GW of CIGS
cells (roughly the amount of silicon cells produced in 2006) would use
about 10% of the indium produced in 2004.[7] For comparison, silicon
solar cells used up 33% of the world's electronic grade silicon
production in 2006! [Nanosolar](/wiki/Nanosolar "wikilink") claims to waste
only 5% of the indium it uses. As of 2006, the best conversion
efficiency for flexible CIGS cells on polyimide is 14.1% by Tiwari et
al, at the ETH, Switzerland.

That being said, indium can easily be recycled from decommissioned PV
modules. The recycling program in Germany would be one good example to
follow. It also highlights the new regenerative industrial paradigm:
"From cradle to cradle".

Selenium allows for better uniformity across the layer and so the number
of recombination sites in the film are reduced which benefits the
quantum efficiency and thus the conversion efficiency.

</table>

The materials based on CuInSe<sub>2</sub> that are of interest for
photovoltaic applications include several elements from groups I, III
and VI in the periodic table. These semiconductors are especially
attractive for thin film solar cell application because of their high
optical absorption coefficients and versatile optical and electrical
characteristics which can in principle be manipulated and tuned for a
specific need in a given device. CIS is an abbreviation for general
chalcopyrite films of copper indium selenide
(**C**u**I**n**S**e<sub>2</sub>), CIGS mentioned above is a variation of
CIS. While these films can achieve 13.5% efficiency, their manufacturing
costs at present are high when compared with a silicon solar cell but
continuing work is leading to more cost-effective production processes.
A manufacturing plant was built in Germany by [Würth
Solar](http://www.wuerth-solar.de). It was inaugurated in October 2006.
Full production is expected by end of 2006. There are [more
plans](http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story;jsessionid=6F1C4628719BC4EDC2B52523F791D5F3?id=46677)
by AVANCIS and Shell in a joint effort to build another plant in Germany
with a capacity of 20 MW. Honda in Japan has finished its pilot-plant
testing and is launching its commercial production. In North America,
Global Solar has been producing pliable CIS solar cell in smaller scale
since 2001. Apart from Daystar Technologies and Nanosolar mentioned in
CIGS, there are other potential manufacturers coming on line such as
Miasole using a vacuum sputtering method and also a Canadian initiative
[CIS Solar](http://www.cissolar.com) attempting to make solar cells by
low cost electroplating process.

#### Gallium arsenide (GaAs) multijunction

High-efficiency cells have been developed for special applications such
as [satellites](/wiki/Satellite#Artificial_satellites "wikilink") and [space
exploration](space_exploration "wikilink"). These multijunction cells
consist of multiple thin films produced using [molecular beam
epitaxy](molecular_beam_epitaxy "wikilink"). A triple-junction cell, for
example, may consist of the semiconductors: GaAs, Ge, and
GaInP<sub>2</sub>.[8] Each type of semiconductor will have a
characteristic [band gap](band_gap "wikilink") energy which, loosely
speaking, causes it to absorb light most efficiently at a certain color,
or more precisely, to absorb [electromagnetic
radiation](electromagnetic_radiation "wikilink") over a portion of the
spectrum. The semiconductors are carefully chosen to absorb nearly all
of the solar spectrum, thus generating electricity from as much of the
solar energy as possible. GaAs multijunction devices are the most
efficient solar cells to date, reaching as high as 29% efficiency.[9]
They are also some of the most expensive cells per unit area (up to
US$40/cm²).

#### Light absorbing dyes

`  `` `

Typically a Ruthenium metalorganic dye (Ru-centered) used as a monolayer
of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a
mesoporous layer of [nanoparticulate](nanoparticulate "wikilink")
[titanium dioxide](titanium_dioxide "wikilink") to greatly amplify the
surface area (200-300 m²/gram TiO<sub>2</sub>, as compared to
approximately 10 m²/gram of flat single crystal). The photogenerated
electrons from the *light absorbing dye* are passed on to the *n-type*
TiO<sub>2</sub>, and the holes are passed to an electrolyte on the other
side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a redox couple in the
electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows a
more flexible use of materials, and typically are manufactured by screen
printing, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used
for *bulk* solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer
from degradation under heat and UV light, and the cell casing is
difficult to seal due to the solvents used in assembly. In spite of the
above, this is a popular emerging technology with some commercial impact
forecasted within this decade.

#### Organic/polymer solar cells

Organic solar cells and [Polymer solar
cells](/wiki/Polymer_solar_cell "wikilink") are built from thin films
(typically 100 nm) of [organic
semiconductors](organic_semiconductor "wikilink") such as polymers and
small-molecule compounds like [polyphenylene
vinylene](polyphenylene_vinylene "wikilink"), copper phthalocyanine (a
blue or green organic pigment) and [carbon
fullerenes](fullerene "wikilink"). Energy conversion efficiencies
achieved to date using conductive polymers are low at 4-5% efficiency
for the best cells to date. However, these cells could be beneficial for
some applications where mechanical flexibility and disposability are
important.

#### Silicon

[Silicon](/wiki/Silicon "wikilink") thin-films are mainly deposited by
[Chemical vapor deposition](/wiki/Chemical_vapor_deposition "wikilink")
(typically plasma enhanced (PE-CVD)) from [silane](silane "wikilink")
gas and [hydrogen](hydrogen "wikilink") gas. Depending on the
deposition's parameters, this can yield:

1.  [Amorphous silicon](/wiki/Amorphous_silicon "wikilink") (a-Si or a-Si:H)
2.  [protocrystalline silicon](/wiki/Protocrystalline "wikilink") or
3.  [Nanocrystalline silicon](/wiki/Nanocrystalline_silicon "wikilink") (nc-Si
    or nc-Si:H).

These types of silicon present dangling and twisted bonds, which results
in deep defects (energy levels in the bandgap) as well as deformation of
the valence and conduction bands (band tails). The solar cells made from
these materials tend to have lower *energy conversion efficiency* than
*bulk* silicon, but are also less expensive to produce. The [quantum
efficiency](quantum_efficiency "wikilink") of thin film solar cells is
also lower due to reduced number of collected charge carriers per
incident photon.

Amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7 eV) than crystalline silicon
(c-Si) (1.1 eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar
spectrum more strongly than the [infrared](infrared "wikilink") portion
of the spectrum. As **nc-Si** has about the same bandgap as c-Si, the
two material can be combined in thin layers, creating a layered cell
called a **tandem cell**. The top cell in a-Si absorbs the visible light
and leaves the infrared part of the spectrum for the bottom cell in
nanocrystalline Si.

Recently, solutions to overcome the limitations of thin film crystalline
silicon have been developed. Light trapping schemes where the incoming
light is obliquely coupled into the silicon and the light traverses the
film several times enhance the absorption of sunlight in the films.
Thermal processing techniques enhance the crystallinity of the silicon
and passify electronic defects. The result is a new technology — **thin
film Crystaline Silicon on Glass
(CSG)**[1](http://www.csgsolar.com/downloads/CSG_Press_PVSC31Jan2005.pdf).
CSG solar devices represent a balance between the low cost of thin films
and the high efficiency of bulk silicon.

A silicon thin film technology is being developed for building
integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) in the form of semi-transparent solar
cells which can be applied as window glazing. These cells function as
window tinting while generating electricity.

### Nanocrystalline solar cells

These structures make use of some of the same thin-film light absorbing
materials but are overlain as an extremely thin absorber on a supporting
matrix of conductive polymer or mesoporous metal oxide having a very
high surface area to increase internal reflections (and hence increase
the probability of light absorption).

Concentrating photovoltaics (CPV)
---------------------------------

Concentrating photovoltaic systems use a large area of lenses or mirrors
to focus sunlight on a small area of photovoltaic cells.[10] If these
systems use single or dual-axis tracking to improve performance, they
may be referred to as *Heliostat Concentrator Photovoltaics* (HCPV). The
primary attraction of CPV systems is their reduced usage of
semiconducting material which is expensive and currently in short
supply. Additionally, increasing the concentration ratio improves the
performance of general photovoltaic materials[11] and also allows for
the use of high-performance materials such as [gallium
arsenide](/wiki/Solar_cells#Gallium_arsenide_.28GaAs.29_multijunction "wikilink").[12]
Despite the advantages of CPV technologies their application has been
limited by the costs of focusing, tracking and cooling equipment. ***On
[October 25](/wiki/October_25 "wikilink"), [2006](2006 "wikilink"), Australia
announced it would construct a solar plant using this technology to come
online in 2008 and be completed by 2013. This plant, at 154 MW***, would
be ten times larger than the largest current photovoltaic plant in the
world.[13]

Silicon solar cell device manufacture
-------------------------------------

Because solar cells are semiconductor devices, they share many of the
same processing and manufacturing techniques as other semiconductor
devices such as [computer](computer "wikilink") and
[memory](computer_storage "wikilink")
[chips](integrated_circuit "wikilink"). However, the stringent
requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor
fabrication are a little more relaxed for solar cells. Most large-scale
commercial solar cell factories today make screen printed
poly-crystalline silicon solar cells. Single crystalline wafers which
are used in the semiconductor industry can be made into excellent high
efficiency solar cells, but they are generally considered to be too
expensive for large-scale mass production.

Poly-crystalline silicon wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast
silicon ingots into very thin (180 to 350 micrometer) slices or wafers.
The wafers are usually lightly p-type doped. To make a solar cell from
the wafer, a surface diffusion of n-type dopants is performed on the
front side of the wafer. This forms a p-n junction a few hundred
nanometers below the surface.

Antireflection coatings, which increase the amount of light coupled into
the solar cell, are typically applied next. Over the past decade,
***silicon nitride has gradually replaced titanium dioxide*** as the
antireflection coating of choice because of its excellent surface
passivation qualities (i.e., it prevents carrier recombination at the
surface of the solar cell). It is typically applied in a layer several
hundred nanometers thick using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(PECVD). Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like
antireflection coatings, serve to increase the amount of light coupled
into the cell. Such surfaces can usually only be formed on
single-crystal silicon, though in recent years methods of forming them
on multicrystalline silicon have been developed.

The wafer is then metallized, whereby a full area metal contact is made
on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine
"fingers" and larger "busbars" is screen-printed onto the front surface
using a [silver](silver "wikilink") paste. The rear contact is also
formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually
this contact covers the entire rear side of the cell, though in some
cell designs it is printed in a grid pattern. The metal electrodes will
then require some kind of heat treatment or "sintering" to make [Ohmic
contact](/wiki/Ohmic_contact "wikilink") with the silicon. After the metal
contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected in series (and/or
parallel) by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into modules or
"solar panels". Solar panels have a sheet of tempered
[glass](glass "wikilink") on the front, and a
[polymer](polymer "wikilink") encapsulation on the back. Tempered glass
cannot be used with amorphous silicon cells because of the high
temperatures during the deposition process.

Current research on materials and devices
-----------------------------------------

`   `

There are currently many research groups active in the field of
[photovoltaics](photovoltaics "wikilink") in
[universities](universities "wikilink") and research institutions around
the world. This research can be divided into three areas: making current
technology solar cells cheaper and/or more efficient to effectively
compete with other energy sources; developing new technologies based on
new solar cell architectural designs; and developing new materials to
serve as light absorbers and charge carriers.

### Silicon processing

One way of doing this is to develop cheaper methods of obtaining silicon
that is sufficiently pure. Silicon is a very common element, but is
normally bound in silica, or [silica sand](sand "wikilink"). Processing
silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) to produce silicon is a very high energy
process, and more energy efficient methods of synthesis are not only
beneficial to the solar industry, but also to industries surrounding
silicon technology as a whole.

The current industrial production of silicon is via the reaction between
carbon (charcoal) and silica at a temperature around 1700 [degrees
Celsius](degrees_Celsius "wikilink"). In this process, known as
carbothermic reduction, each tonne of silicon (metallurgical grade,
about 98% pure) is produced with the emission of about 1.5 tonnes of
carbon dioxide.

Solid silica can be directly converted (reduced) to pure silicon by
electrolysis in a molten salt bath at a fairly mild temperature (800 to
900 degrees Celsius).[14][15] While this new process is in principle the
same as the [FFC Cambridge Process](/wiki/FFC_Cambridge_Process "wikilink")
which was first discovered in late 1996, the interesting laboratory
finding is that such electrolytic silicon is in the form of porous
silicon which turns readily into a fine powder, (with a particle size of
a few micrometres), and may therefore offer new opportunities for
development of solar cell technologies.

Another approach is also to reduce the amount of silicon used and thus
cost, as done by Professor [Andrew Blakers](/wiki/Andrew_Blakers "wikilink")
at the [Australian National
University](/wiki/Australian_National_University "wikilink") with their
"Sliver" cells, by micromachining wafers into very thin, virtually
transparent layers that could be used as transparent architectural
coverings.[16] Using this technique, one silicon wafer is enough to
build a 140 watt panel, compared to about 60 wafers needed for
conventional modules of same power output.

Yet another way to achieve cost improvements is to reduce wastes during
the crystal formation by improved modelisation of the process, as done
by [FemagSoft](/wiki/FemagSoft "wikilink"), spin-off of the [Université
Catholique de Louvain](/wiki/Université_Catholique_de_Louvain "wikilink").

Another novel approach employed by [Evergreen
Solar](/wiki/Evergreen_Solar "wikilink") is to grow silicon ribbons from
specialized 'string puller' furnaces. They claim to be able to produce
thinner cells without machining waste plus the resulting cells are
naturally rectangular in shape.

### Thin-film processing

Thin-film solar cells use less than 1% of the raw material (silicon or
other light absorbers) compared to wafer based solar cells, leading to a
significant price drop per kWh. There are many research groups around
the world actively researching different thin-film approaches and/or
materials, however it remains to be seen if these solutions can generate
the same space-efficiency as traditional silicon processing.

One particularly promising technology is crystalline silicon thin films
on glass substrates. This technology makes use of the advantages of
crystalline silicon as a solar cell material, with the cost savings of
using a thin-film approach.

Another interesting aspect of thin-film solar cells is the possibility
to deposit the cells on all kind of materials, including flexible
substrates ([PET](/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate "wikilink") for example),
which opens a new dimension for new applications.

### Polymer processing

The invention of [conductive polymers](conductive_polymers "wikilink")
(for which [Alan Heeger](/wiki/Alan_Heeger "wikilink"), [Alan G.
MacDiarmid](/wiki/Alan_G._MacDiarmid "wikilink") and [Hideki
Shirakawa](/wiki/Hideki_Shirakawa "wikilink") were awarded a [Nobel
prize](/wiki/Nobel_prize "wikilink")) may lead to the development of much
cheaper cells that are based on inexpensive plastics. However, all
[organic solar cells](organic_solar_cells "wikilink") made to date
suffer from degradation upon exposure to [UV](/wiki/UV "wikilink") light, and
hence have lifetimes which are far too short to be viable. The
conjugated double bond systems in the polymers, which carry the charge,
are always susceptible to breaking up when radiated with shorter
wavelengths. Additionally, most conductive polymers, being highly
unsaturated and reactive, are highly sensitive to atmospheric moisture
and oxidation, making commercial applications difficult.

### Nanoparticle processing

Experimental non-silicon solar panels can be made of [quantum
heterostructures](quantum_heterostructure "wikilink"), eg. [carbon
nanotubes](carbon_nanotube "wikilink") or [quantum
dots](quantum_dot "wikilink"), embedded in [conductive
polymers](conductive_polymers "wikilink") or mesoporous metal oxides. In
addition, thin films of many of these materials on conventional silicon
solar cells can increase the optical coupling efficiency into the
silicon cell, thus boosting the overal efficiency. By varying the size
of the quantum dots, the cells can be tuned to absorb different
wavelengths. Although the research is still in its infancy, [quantum
dot](quantum_dot "wikilink")-modified photovoltaics may be able to
achieve up to 42 percent energy conversion efficiency due to multiple
exciton generation.[17]

### Transparent conductors

Many new solar cells use transparent thin films that are also conductors
of electrical charge. The dominant conductive thin films used in
research now are transparent conductive oxides (abbreviated "TCO"), and
include fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>:F, or "FTO"), doped
zinc oxide (e.g.: ZnO:Al), and [indium tin
oxide](indium_tin_oxide "wikilink") (abbreviated "ITO"). These
conductive films are also used in the LCD industry for flat panel
displays. The dual function of a TCO allows light to pass through a
substrate window to the active light absorbing material beneath, and
also serves as an ohmic contact to transport photogenerated charge
carriers away from that light absorbing material. The present TCO
materials are effective for research, but perhaps are not yet optimized
for large-scale photovoltaic production. They require very special
deposition conditions at high vacuum, they can sometimes suffer from
poor mechanical strength, and most have poor transmittance in the
infrared portion of the spectrum (e.g.: ITO thin films can also be used
as infrared filters in airplane windows). These factors make large-scale
manufacturing more costly.

A relatively new area has emerged using [carbon
nanotube](carbon_nanotube "wikilink") networks as a transparent
conductor for organic solar cells. Nanotube networks are flexible and
can be deposited on surfaces a variety of ways. With some treatment,
nanotube films can be highly transparent in the infrared, possibly
enabling efficient low bandgap solar cells. Nanotube networks are p-type
conductors, whereas traditional transparent conductors are exclusively
n-type. The availability of a p-type transparent conductor could lead to
new cell designs that simplify manufacturing and improve efficiency.

### Silicon wafer based solar cells

Despite the numerous attempts at making better solar cells by using new
and exotic materials, the reality is that the photovoltaics market is
still dominated by silicon wafer-based solar cells (first-generation
solar cells). This means that most solar cell manufacturers are equipped
to produce these type of solar cells. Therefore, a large body of
research is currently being done all over the world to create silicon
wafer-based solar cells that can achieve higher conversion efficiency
without an exorbitant increase in production cost. The aim of the
research is to achieve the lowest $/watt solar cell design that is
suitable for commercial production.

### Sliver cells

[Australian National
University](/wiki/Australian_National_University "wikilink") and Origin Energy
have developed a technique for slicing a single silicon wafer, which
allows a significantly larger collector surface area, compared to usual
solar cells. The technique involves taking a silicon wafer, typically 1
to 2mm thick, and creating a multitude of slices downward, creating a
large number of slivers that are 50 micrometres thick. These slices are
rotated 90 degrees, thereby multiplying the surface area of exposed
silicon. The electrical doping and contacts are placed on either side of
the sliver, rather than the traditional front and rear. This has the
interesting effect of making the cell sensitive from both the front and
rear of the cell.[18]
