</figure>A **battery electric vehicle** (BEV) is an [electric
vehicle](electric_vehicle "wikilink") that utilizes chemical
[energy](energy "wikilink") stored in [rechargeable
battery](rechargeable_battery "wikilink")
[packs](battery_pack "wikilink"). Electric vehicles use [electric
motors](electric_motor "wikilink") instead of, or in addition to,
[internal combustion engines](internal_combustion_engine "wikilink")
(ICEs). Vehicles using both, electric motors and ICEs, are examples of
[hybrid vehicles](hybrid_vehicle "wikilink"), and are usually not
considered pure BEVs. Hybrid vehicles with batteries that can be charged
and used without their ICE are called [plug-in
hybrid](plug-in_hybrid "wikilink") electric vehicles, and are pure BEVs
while they are not burning fuel. BEVs are usually
[automobiles](automobile "wikilink"), [light
trucks](/wiki/Truck#Light_trucks "wikilink"), [motorized
bicycles](/wiki/Motorized_bicycle#Electric "wikilink"), [electric
scooters](electric_scooter "wikilink"), [golf
carts](golf_cart "wikilink"), [forklifts](/wiki/Forklift_truck "wikilink") and
similar vehicles, because batteries are less appropriate for larger
long-range applications.

BEVs were among the earliest automobiles, and are more
[energy-efficient](/wiki/Energy_efficiency "wikilink") than all internal
combustion vehicles. BEVs produce no exhaust fumes, and minimal
pollution if charged from most forms of [renewable
energy](renewable_energy "wikilink"). Many are capable of
[acceleration](acceleration "wikilink") exceeding that of conventional
[gasoline](gasoline "wikilink") powered vehicles. BEVs reduce dependence
on [petroleum](petroleum "wikilink"), mitigate [global
warming](global_warming "wikilink") by alleviating the [greenhouse
effect](greenhouse_effect "wikilink"), are quieter than internal
combustion vehicles, and do not produce noxious fumes.

Ongoing battery technology advancements have addressed many problems
with high costs, limited travel distance between battery recharging,
charging time, and battery lifespan. Those drawbacks have historically
been blamed for the limited adoption of the BEV. Toyota, Honda, Ford and
General Motors all produced BEVs in the 90s, but only because they were
forced to do so by [California Air Resources
Board](/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board "wikilink")'s Zero Emission
Vehicle Mandate. The major US automobile manufacturers have been accused
of deliberately [sabotaging](/wiki/Sabotage "wikilink") their electric vehicle
production efforts.[1][2] A handful of future production models have
been announced, although many more have been prototyped.

</figure>BEVs were among some of the earliest automobiles, because
electric vehicles [predate](predate "wikilink") gasoline and diesel.
Between 1832 and 1839 (the exact year is uncertain),
[Scottish](/wiki/Scotland "wikilink") businessman [Robert
Anderson](/wiki/Robert_Anderson_(businessman) "wikilink") invented the first
crude electric carriage. Professor [Sibrandus
Stratingh](/wiki/Sibrandus_Stratingh "wikilink") of Groningen, Netherlands,
designed the small-scale electric car, built by his assistant
[Christopher Becker](/wiki/Christopher_Becker "wikilink") in 1835.

The improvement of the storage battery, by Frenchmen [Gaston
Plante](/wiki/Gaston_Plante "wikilink") in 1865 and by [Camille
Faure](/wiki/Camille_Faure "wikilink") in 1881, paved the way for electric
vehicles to flourish. France and Great Britain were the first nations to
support the widespread development of electric vehicles.[3]

Just prior to 1900, before the pre-eminence of powerful but polluting
[internal combustion engines](internal_combustion_engines "wikilink"),
electric automobiles held many speed and distance records. Among the
most notable of these records was the breaking of the 100 km/h (60 mph)
speed barrier, by [Camille Jenatzy](/wiki/Camille_Jenatzy "wikilink") on
[April 29](/wiki/April_29 "wikilink"), 1899 in his 'rocket-shaped' EV, [Jamais
Contente](/wiki/Jamais_Contente "wikilink") which reached a top speed of
105.88 km/h (65.79 mph).

BEVs, produced by [Anthony](/wiki/Anthony_Electric "wikilink"),
[Baker](/wiki/Baker_Motor_Vehicle "wikilink"),
[Detroit](/wiki/Detroit_Electric "wikilink"), [Edison](Edison "wikilink"),
[Studebaker](/wiki/Studebaker "wikilink"), and others during the early 20th
Century for a time out-sold gasoline-powered vehicles. Due to
technological limitations and the lack of
[transistor](transistor "wikilink")-based electric technology, the top
speed of these early production electric vehicles was limited to about
32 km/h (20 mph). These vehicles were successfully sold as [town
cars](town_car "wikilink") to upper-class customers and were often
marketed as suitable vehicles for women drivers due to their clean,
quiet and easy operation. Electrics did not require hand cranking to
start, and a backfire during hand-cranking could break the owner's arm.

</figure>The introduction of the [electric
starter](electric_starter "wikilink") by
[Cadillac](/wiki/Cadillac_(automobile) "wikilink") in 1913 simplified the task
of starting the internal combustion engine, formerly difficult and
sometimes dangerous. This innovation contributed to the downfall of the
electric vehicle, as did the mass-produced and relatively inexpensive
[Ford Model-T](/wiki/Ford_Model-T "wikilink"), which had been produced for
four years, since 1908.[4] Internal-combustion vehicles advanced
technologically, ultimately becoming more practical than -- and
out-performing -- their electric-powered competitors.

Another blow to BEVs was the loss of
[Edison's](/wiki/Thomas_Edison "wikilink") [direct
current](direct_current "wikilink") electric power transmission system
in the *[War of Currents](/wiki/War_of_Currents "wikilink")*. This deprived
the BEV of the source of DC current necessary to recharge their
batteries. As the technology of [rectifiers](rectifier "wikilink") was
still in its infancy, producing DC current locally was infeasible.

Battery electric vehicles became popular for some limited range
applications. Forklifts were BEVs when they were introduced in 1923 by
Yale[1](http://www.yale.com/ygl_history.asp?language=ENGLISH) and some
battery electric fork lifts are still produced. Golf carts have been BEV
since their introduction including early models by Lektra in
1954.[2](http://www.lektro.com/about_history.asp) Their popularity led
to their use as [neighborhood electric
vehicles](neighborhood_electric_vehicle "wikilink") and expanded
versions became available which were partially "street legal".

By the late 1930s, the electric automobile industry had completely
disappeared, with battery-electric traction being limited to niche
applications, such as certain industrial vehicles.

The 1947 invention of the point-contact
[transistor](transistor "wikilink") marked the beginning of a new era
for BEV technology. Within a decade, Henney Coachworks had joined forces
with National Union Electric Company, the makers of Exide batteries, to
produce the first modern electric car based on transistor technology,
the [Henney Kilowatt](/wiki/Henney_Kilowatt "wikilink"), produced in 36-volt
and 72-volt configurations. The 72-volt models had a top speed
approaching 96 km/h (60 mph) and could travel nearly an hour on a single
charge. Despite the improved practicality of the Henney Kilowatt over
previous electric cars, it was too expensive, and production was
terminated in 1961. Even though the Henney Kilowatt never reached mass
production volume, their transistor-based electric technology paved the
way for modern EVs.

After California indicated that it would kill its
[ZEV](/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle "wikilink") Mandate, Toyota offered the
last 328 RAV4-EV for sale to the general public during six months
(ending on Nov. 22, 2002). All the rest were only leased, and with minor
exceptions those models were withdrawn from the market and destroyed by
manufacturers (other than Toyota). Toyota not only supports the 328
Toyota RAV4-EV in the hands of the general public, still all running at
this date, but also supports hundreds in fleet usage. From time to time,
Toyota RAV4-EV come up for sale on the used market, at prices that have
ranged up to the mid 60 thousands of dollars. These are highly prized by
solar homeowners who wish to charge their cars from their solar electric
rooftop systems.

As of July, 2006, there are between 60,000 and 76,000 low-speed, battery
powered vehicles in use in the US, up from about 56,000 in 2004
according to Electric Drive Transportation Association estimates.[5]

</figure>France  

[France](/wiki/France "wikilink") saw a large development of battery-electric
vehicles in the 1990s; the most successful vehicle was the electric
[Peugeot Partner](/wiki/Peugeot_Partner "wikilink")/[Citroën
Berlingo](/wiki/Citroën_Berlingo "wikilink"), of which several thousand have
been built, mostly for fleet use in municipalities and by [Electricité
de France](/wiki/Electricité_de_France "wikilink").

Norway  

In [Norway](/wiki/Norway "wikilink"), zero-emission vehicles are tax-exempt
and are allowed to use the [bus lane](bus_lane "wikilink").

Switzerland  

In [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland "wikilink"), battery-electric vehicles are
popular with private users. From 1985 to about 1995 there was an annual
kind of nation-wide race for solar powered vehicles called the Tour de
Sol. This resulted in the development of stylish and useful vehicles,
mostly one and two-seaters with three wheels. Some vehicles were powered
exclusively by on-board solar cells, some additionally by human power,
but most used primarily indirect solar energy fed into the national
electricity grid by stationary solar installations. There is a national
network of publicly accessible charging points, called [Park &
Charge](http://www.twikeklub.ch/lemnet/index.htm), which also covers
part of [Germany](/wiki/Germany "wikilink") and [Austria](Austria "wikilink").

United Kingdom  

In [London](/wiki/London "wikilink"), electrically powered vehicles are exempt
from the [congestion charge](/wiki/London_congestion_charge "wikilink"),
although BEVs need to be registered and pay an annual £10 fee. With a £8
payable daily charge, this could provide a potential annual saving of up
to £2000 - and is the reason that most UK BEVs are currently sold in
London.

In most [UK](/wiki/United_Kingdom "wikilink") cities, low-speed electric [milk
floats](milk_float "wikilink") (milk trucks) are used for the home
delivery of fresh [milk](milk "wikilink"). An active hobbyist group
called the Battery Vehicle Society regularly organises racing events for
mostly home-built vehicles. The inventor Sir Clive Sinclair developed an
extremely cheap small three wheeler called the C-5. This generated an
enormous amount of publicity but not enough sales to continue the
development.

Italy  

In [Italy](/wiki/Italy "wikilink"), all private ZEVs are exempt from taxes and
have a substantial insurance fee reduction. In most cities the trash
collection is performed by BEV trucks. Furthermore access to certain
city centres is restricted for internal combustion engines (like in
Rome) enabling the use of electric vehicles (small transporters and
buses).

### Regulation in California

Since the late 1980s, electric vehicles have been promoted in the US
through the use of tax credits. BEVs are the most common form of what is
defined by the [California Air Resources
Board](/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board "wikilink") (CARB) as [zero
emission vehicle](zero_emission_vehicle "wikilink") (ZEV) passenger
[automobiles](automobile "wikilink"), because they produce no emissions
while being driven. The CARB had set a minimum quota for the use of
ZEVs, but it was withdrawn after complaints by auto manufacturers that
it was economically infeasible due to an alleged "lack of consumer
demand".

The California program was designed by the CARB to reduce air pollution
and not specifically to promote electric vehicles. So the zero emissions
requirement in California was replaced by a combined requirement of a
very small number of ZEVs to promote research and development, and a
much larger number of [partial zero-emissions
vehicles](partial_zero-emissions_vehicle "wikilink") (PZEVs), an
administrative designation for a *super ultra low emissions vehicle*
([SULEV](/wiki/SULEV "wikilink")), which emit about ten percent of the
pollution of ordinary low emissions vehicles and are also certified for
zero evaporative emissions.

Comparison to internal combustion vehicles
------------------------------------------

<figure>
<img src="tzeroviper.jpg" title=" Tzero an older model electric vehicle on a drag race with a Dodge Viper left behind" alt=" Tzero an older model electric vehicle on a drag race with a Dodge Viper left behind" width="250" /><figcaption> <a href="Tzero" title="wikilink">Tzero</a> an older model electric vehicle on a drag race with a Dodge Viper left behind</figcaption>
</figure>BEVs have become much less common than [Internal combustion
engine](/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine "wikilink") vehicles (ICEV).
Therefore, it is often helpful to consider many aspects of BEVs in
comparison to [ICE](/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine "wikilink") vehicles.

### Cost

Electric vehicles typically cost between two and four cents per mile to
operate, while gasoline-powered ICE vehicles currently cost about four
to six times as much.[6] The total cost of ownership for modern BEVs
depends primarily on the [cost of the batteries](#Batteries "wikilink"),
the type and capacity of which determine several factors such as travel
range, top speed, battery lifetime and recharging time; several
trade-offs exist.

Batteries are usually the most expensive component of BEVs, though the
price per [kWh](kWh "wikilink") of charge has fallen rapidly in recent
years. The cost of battery manufacture is substantial, but increasing
[returns to scale](returns_to_scale "wikilink") may serve to lower their
cost when BEVs are manufactured on the scale of modern internal
combustion vehicles. Since the late 1990s, advances in battery
technologies have been driven by skyrocketing demand for
[laptop](laptop "wikilink") computers and [mobile
phones](mobile_phone "wikilink"), with consumer demand for more
features, larger, brighter displays, and longer battery time driving
research and development in the field. The BEV marketplace has reaped
the benefits of these advances.

10 [kWh](kWh "wikilink") of battery power provides a range of about 20
miles in a Toyota Prius.[7] For prices of a kWh of charge with various
different battery technologies, see the "Energy/Consumer Price" column
in the "[Comparison of battery
types](/wiki/Rechargeable_battery#Comparison_of_battery_types "wikilink")"
section in the rechargeable battery article.

**Ownership costs**

Ownership costs for battery electric cars are higher than for their
petrol or diesel equivalents, primarily because their purchase price is
higher to begin with. Typically for a new car, or a small van, the price
is increased by up to 80%. Very often the batteries are not included
within the purchase price because they are also expensive. Instead they
are often leased for £60-£70 ($116-$135) a month. If the battery is
purchased outright, the owner will also be required to replace it every
3 to 5 years, depending on the battery type.

In the UK other changes in ownership costs include vehicle excise duty
or road tax. Electric vehicles are now exempt and so BEV owners will
save around £100 per year compared with an average conventional car.
There remains some uncertainty about annual depreciation rates and
resale values for BEVs due to the unknown length of battery-life and the
low demand for battery electrics compared to other green car types. As
BEVs lose their value faster than conventional cars depreciation rates
are likely to be higher than for a conventional car at this time.

In the UK, BEV users who install additional recharging equipment will
face additional financial penalties. Costs per standard charge point are
around £500-£2000, depending on the difficulty of installation. Fully
installed fast-chargers will cost between £10,000 and £30,000 per point
although this depends on whether an on-board or off-board fast-charging
system is used.

**Running costs**

Some running costs are significantly less for BEVs than for conventional
cars. In particular, fuel costs are very low due to the competitive
price of electricity - fuel duty is zero-rated - and to the high
efficiency of the vehicles themselves. Taking into account the high fuel
economy of battery electric cars, the fuel costs can be as low as
1.0-2.5p per mile (depending on the tariff). For a typical annual
mileage of around 10,000 miles per year, switching from a conventional
car to a battery electric could save you around £800 in fuel costs.
However if the battery hire is considered a running cost, then the
saving on fuel is cancelled out by the monthly battery leasing cost.

### Energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions

Production and [conversion](/wiki/Electric_vehicle_conversion "wikilink") BEVs
using [NiMH](/wiki/NiMH "wikilink") battery chemistry typically use 0.3 to 0.5
kilowatt-hours per mile (0.2–0.3 kWh/km).[8][9] Nearly half of this
power consumption is due to
[inefficiencies](/wiki/Energy_efficiency "wikilink") in charging the
batteries. The US fleet average of 23 miles per gallon of
[gasoline](gasoline "wikilink") is equivalent to 1.58 kWh per mile and
the 70 MPG [Honda Insight](/wiki/Honda_Insight "wikilink") gets 0.52 kWh per
mile (assuming 36.4 kWh per US gallon of gasoline), so battery electric
vehicles are relatively [energy
efficient](energy_efficiency "wikilink").

<figure>
<img src="Sources_of_Electricity_in_the_US_2005_New.png" title="Sources of electricity in the U.S. 20053" alt="Sources of electricity in the U.S. 20053" width="300" /><figcaption>Sources of electricity in the U.S. 2005<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat1p1.html">3</a></figcaption>
</figure>Generating electricity and providing liquid fuels for vehicles
are different categories of the energy economy, with different
inefficiencies and environmental harms. When considering only the
driving cycle (ie, not the charging and electricity production) a 55 %
to 99.9 % improvement in [CO2](/wiki/CO2 "wikilink") emissions takes place
when driving an EV over an [ICE](/wiki/ICE "wikilink") (gasoline, diesel)
vehicle.[10]

[Carbon dioxide](/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "wikilink") (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions
are useful for comparison of electricity and gasoline consumption.[11]
Such comparisons include energy production, transmission, charging, and
vehicle losses. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions improve in BEVs with
[sustainable](sustainable "wikilink") electricity production but are
fixed for gasoline vehicles.

[Aerodynamic drag](/wiki/Drag_(physics) "wikilink") has a large impact on
energy efficiency as the speed of the vehicle increases. [A list of cars
and their corresponding drag
coefficients](/wiki/Drag_coefficient#Typical_values_and_examples "wikilink")
is available.

### Maintenance

EVs, particularly those using AC or [brushless
DC](/wiki/Brushless_DC_motor "wikilink") motors, have far fewer mechanical
parts to wear out. An ICE vehicle on the other hand will have pistons,
valves, camshafts, cambelts, gearbox and a clutch, all of which can wear
out.

### Acceleration performance

![[Venturi Fetish](/wiki/Venturi_Fetish "wikilink") - a limited production
electric car capable of reaching 0-100km/h in 4.5
seconds](VenturiFetish.jpg "Venturi Fetish - a limited production electric car capable of reaching 0-100km/h in 4.5 seconds")

Relatively few of today's BEVs are capable of
[acceleration](acceleration "wikilink") performance which exceeds that
of equivalent-class conventional gasoline powered vehicles. An early
solution was [American Motors](/wiki/American_Motors "wikilink")’ experimental
[Amitron](/wiki/Amitron "wikilink") piggyback system of batteries with one
type designed for sustained speeds while a different set boosted
acceleration when needed.

Electric vehicles can utilize a direct motor-to-wheel configuration
which increases the amount of available
[power](/wiki/Power_(physics) "wikilink"). Having multiple motors connected
directly to the wheels allows for each of the wheels to be used for both
propulsion and as braking systems, thereby increasing
[traction](traction "wikilink"). In some cases, the motor can be housed
directly in the wheel, such as in the [Whispering
Wheel](/wiki/Whispering_Wheel "wikilink") design, which lowers the vehicle's
[center of gravity](center_of_gravity "wikilink") and reduces the number
of moving parts. When not fitted with an [axle](axle "wikilink"),
[differential](/wiki/Differential_(mechanics) "wikilink"), or
[transmission](/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics) "wikilink"), electric vehicles
have less drivetrain rotational inertia.

A gearless or single gear design in some BEVs eliminates the need for
gear shifting, giving such vehicles both smoother acceleration and
smoother braking. Because the torque of an electric motor is a function
of current, not rotational speed, electric vehicles have a high torque
over a larger range of speeds during acceleration, as compared to an
internal combustion engine.

For example, the [Venturi Fetish](/wiki/Venturi_Fetish "wikilink") delivers
[supercar](supercar "wikilink") acceleration despite a relatively modest
300 [horsepower](horsepower "wikilink"), and a top speed of around 100
miles per hour. Some [DC
motor](/wiki/Electric_motor#DC_motors "wikilink")-equipped drag racer BEVs,
have simple two-speed transmissions to improve top speed.[12][13] Larger
vehicles, such as electric trains and land speed record vehicles,
overcome this speed barrier by dramatically increasing the
[wattage](watt "wikilink") of their power system.

Batteries
---------

<img src="NASA_Lithium_Ion_Polymer_Battery.jpg" title="fig:75 watt-hour/kilogram lithium ion polymer battery prototypes. Newer Li-poly cells provide up to 130 Wh/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles." alt="75 watt-hour/kilogram lithium ion polymer battery prototypes. Newer Li-poly cells provide up to 130 Wh/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles." width="220" />

[Rechargeable batteries](/wiki/Rechargeable_battery "wikilink") used in
electric vehicles include [lead-acid](/wiki/Lead-acid_battery "wikilink")
("flooded" and [VRLA](/wiki/VRLA "wikilink")),
[NiCd](/wiki/Nickel-cadmium_battery "wikilink"), [nickel metal
hydride](/wiki/Nickel_metal_hydride_battery "wikilink"), [lithium
ion](/wiki/Lithium_ion_battery "wikilink"), [Li-ion
polymer](/wiki/Lithium_ion_polymer_battery "wikilink"), and, less commonly,
[zinc-air](/wiki/Zinc-air_battery "wikilink") and [molten
salt](/wiki/Molten_salt_battery "wikilink") batteries.

The amount of electricity stored in batteries is measured in
**[kWh](kWh "wikilink")**.

On the other hand, for BEV's to be competitive on a cost per performance
basis to internal combustion engines, improvements in battery
performance would be required.

### Charging

Batteries in BEVs must be periodically recharged (see also Replacing,
below). . BEVs most commonly charge from the [power
grid](power_grid "wikilink") (at home or using a street or shop
[recharging point](recharging_point "wikilink")), which is in turn
generated from a variety of domestic resources; such as
[coal](/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_plant "wikilink"),
[hydroelectricity](hydroelectricity "wikilink"),
[nuclear](/wiki/Nuclear_power "wikilink") and others. Home power such as roof
top [photovoltaic](photovoltaic "wikilink") solar cell panels,
[microhydro](/wiki/Micro_hydro "wikilink") or [wind](Wind_power "wikilink")
may also be used and are promoted because of [global
warming](global_warming "wikilink").

Charging time is limited primarily by the capacity of the
[grid](grid "wikilink") connection. A normal
[household](household "wikilink") [outlet](outlet "wikilink") is between
1.5 [kilowatts](kilowatt "wikilink") (in the US, Canada, Japan, and
other countries with 110 Volt supply) to 3 kilowatts (in countries with
240 [V](/wiki/V "wikilink") supply). The main connection to a house might be
able to sustain 10 kilowatts, and special wiring can be installed to use
this. At this higher power level charging even a small, 7 kilowatt-hour
(14–28 mi) pack, would probably require one hour. This is small compared
to the effective power delivery rate of an average
[petrol](petrol "wikilink") [pump](pump "wikilink"), about 5,000
kilowatts. Even if the supply power can be increased, most batteries do
not accept charge at greater than their charge rate ("C1".)

In 1995, some [charging stations](charging_station "wikilink") charged
BEVs in one hour. In November 1997, Ford purchased a fast-charge system
produced by [AeroVironment](/wiki/AeroVironment "wikilink") called
"PosiCharge" for testing its fleets of [Ranger
EVs](/wiki/Ford_Ranger_EV "wikilink"), which charged their lead-acid batteries
in between six and fifteen minutes. In February 1998, General Motors
announced a version of its "Magne Charge" system which could recharge
[NiMH](/wiki/Nickel_metal_hydride_battery "wikilink") batteries in about ten
minutes, providing a range of sixty to one hundred miles.[14]

In 2005, [handheld](handheld "wikilink") device battery designs by
[Toshiba](/wiki/Toshiba "wikilink") were claimed to be able to accept an 80%
charge in as little as 60 seconds.[15] Scaling this [specific
power](specific_power "wikilink") characteristic up to the same 7
kilowatt-hour EV pack would result in the need for a peak of 336
kilowatts of power from some source for those 60 seconds. It is not
clear that such batteries will work directly in BEVs as heat build-up
may make them unsafe.

In 2007, [Altairnano](/wiki/Altairnano "wikilink")'s
[NanoSafe](/wiki/NanoSafe "wikilink") batteries are rechargeable in a few
minutes, versus hours required for other rechargeable batteries. A
NanoSafe cell can be charged to over 80% charge capacity in about one
minute. Also Nanotechnology enables increased battery [energy
density](energy_density "wikilink") [16].

Most people do not always require fast recharging because they have
enough time, six to eight hours, during the work day or overnight to
recharge. As the charging does not require attention it takes a few
seconds for an owner to [plug](plug "wikilink") in and unplug their
vehicle. Many BEV drivers prefer refueling at home, avoiding the
inconvenience of visiting a [fuel station](fuel_station "wikilink").
Some workplaces provide special parking bays for electric vehicles with
charging equipment provided.

#### Connectors

The charging power can be connected to the car in two ways (electric
coupling). The first is a direct electrical connection known as
[conductive coupling](conductive_coupling "wikilink"). This might be as
simple as a [mains](mains "wikilink") lead into a weatherproof
[socket](socket "wikilink") through special high capacity cables with
connectors to protect the user from [high
voltages](high_voltage "wikilink"). The second approach is known as
[inductive coupling](inductive_coupling "wikilink"). A special
'[paddle](paddle "wikilink")' is inserted into a [slot](slot "wikilink")
on the car. The paddle is one winding of a
[transformer](transformer "wikilink"), while the other is built into the
car. When the paddle is inserted it completes a magnetic circuit which
provides power to the battery pack.

The major advantage of the inductive approach is that there is no
possibility of [electrocution](electric_shock "wikilink") as there are
no exposed conductors, although interlocks can make conductive coupling
nearly as safe. Conductive coupling equipment is lower in cost and much
more efficient due to a vastly lower component count.

#### Travel range before recharging and trailers

<figure>
<img src="GM_EV.jpg" title="The General Motors EV1 had a range of 75 to 150 miles with NiMH batteries in 1999." alt="The General Motors EV1 had a range of 75 to 150 miles with NiMH batteries in 1999." width="250" /><figcaption>The <a href="General_Motors_EV1" title="wikilink">General Motors EV1</a> had a range of 75 to 150 miles with <a href="NiMH" title="wikilink">NiMH</a> batteries in 1999.</figcaption>
</figure>The range of a BEV depends on the number and type of batteries
used, and the performance demands of the driver. The weight and type of
vehicle also have an impact just as they do on the mileage of
[traditional vehicles](traditional_vehicle "wikilink"). [Electric
vehicle conversions](/wiki/Electric_vehicle_conversion "wikilink") depends on
the battery type:

-   Lead-acid batteries are the most available and inexpensive. Such
    conversions generally have a range of 30 to 80 km (20 to 50 miles).
    Production EVs with lead-acid batteries are capable of up to 130 km
    (80 miles) per charge.

<!-- -->

-   [NiMH](/wiki/NiMH "wikilink") batteries have higher energy density and may
    deliver up to 200 km (120 miles) of range.

<!-- -->

-   New [lithium-ion battery](lithium-ion_battery "wikilink")-equipped
    EVs provide 400-500 km (250-300 miles) of range per charge.[17]

Finding the economic balance of range versus performance, battery
capacity versus weight, and battery type versus cost challenges every EV
manufacturer.

With an AC system [regenerative
braking](regenerative_braking "wikilink") can extend range by up to 50%
under extreme traffic conditions without complete stopping. Otherwise,
the range is extended by about 10 to 15% in city driving, and only
negligibly in highway driving, depending upon terrain.

BEVs (including buses and trucks) can also use [genset
trailers](genset_trailer "wikilink") and [pusher
trailers](pusher_trailer "wikilink") in order to extended their range
when desired without the additional weight during normal short range
use. Discharged baset trailers can be replaced by recharged ones in a
route point. If rented then maintenance costs can be deferred to the
agency.

Such BEVs can become [Hybrid vehicles](/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle "wikilink")
depending on the trailer and car types of energy and powertrain.

### Replacing

An alternative to recharging is to exchange drained or nearly drained
batteries (or [battery range extender
modules](battery_range_extender_module "wikilink")) with fully charged
batteries.

### Uploading and grid buffering

[Smart grid](/wiki/Smart_grid "wikilink") allows BEVs to provide power to the
grid, to provide energy during peak load periods, when the selling price
of electricity can be very high.These vehicles can then be recharged
during off-peak hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess
night time generation. Here the vehicles serve as a distributed battery
storage system to buffer power.

### Lifespan

Individual batteries are usually arranged into large [battery
packs](battery_pack "wikilink") of various [voltage](voltage "wikilink")
and [ampere-hour](ampere-hour "wikilink") capacity products to give the
required [energy capacity](energy_capacity "wikilink"). Battery life
should be considered when calculating the extended cost of ownership, as
all batteries eventually wear out and must be replaced. The rate at
which they expire depends on a number of factors.

The depth of discharge (DOD) is the recommended proportion of the total
available energy storage for which that battery will achieve its rated
cycles. Deep cycle lead-acid batteries generally should not be
discharged below 80% capacity. More modern formulations can survive
deeper cycles.

In real world use, some fleet [Toyota RAV4
EVs](/wiki/Toyota_RAV4_EV "wikilink"), using [NiMH](/wiki/NiMH "wikilink")
batteries, have exceeded 100,000 miles (160,000 km) with little
degradation in their daily range.[18] Quoting that report's concluding
assessment:

  
"The five-vehicle test is demonstrating the long-term durability of
Nickel Metal Hydride batteries and electric drive trains. Only slight
performance degradation has been observed to-date on four out of five
vehicles.... EVTC test data provide strong evidence that all five
vehicles will exceed the 100,000-mile mark. SCE’s positive experience
points to the very strong likelihood of a 130,000 to 150,000-mile Nickel
Metal Hydride battery and drive-train operational life. EVs can
therefore match or exceed the lifecycle miles of comparable internal
combustion engine vehicles.

<!-- -->

  
"In June 2003 the 320 RAV4 EVs of the SCE fleet were used primarily by
meter readers, service managers, field representatives, service planners
and mail handlers, and for security patrols and carpools. In five years
of operation, the RAV4 EV fleet had logged more than 6.9 million miles,
eliminating about 830 tons of air pollutants, and preventing more than
3,700 tons of tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions. Given the successful
operation of its EVs to-date, SCE plans to continue using them well
after they all log 100,000-miles."

[Jay Leno](/wiki/Jay_Leno "wikilink")'s 1909 Baker Electric (see [Baker Motor
Vehicle](/wiki/Baker_Motor_Vehicle "wikilink")) still operates on its original
[Edison cells](/wiki/Edison_cell "wikilink"). Battery replacement costs of
BEVs may be partially or fully offset by the lack of regular maintenance
such as oil and filter changes required for internal combustion engine
vehicles, and by the greater reliability of BEVs due to their fewer
moving parts. They also do away with many other parts that normally
require servicing and maintenance in a regular car, such as on the
gearbox, cooling system, and engine tuning. And by the time batteries do
finally need replacement, they can be replaced with later generation
ones which may offer better performance characteristics, in the same way
as you might replace old batteries from a digital camera with improved
ones.

### Safety

The safety issues of battery electric vehicles are largely dealt with by
the international standard [ISO](/wiki/ISO "wikilink") 6469. This document is
divided in three parts dealing with specific issues:

-   On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery
-   Functional safety means and protection against failures
-   Protection of persons against electrical hazards.

[Firefighters](/wiki/Firefighter "wikilink") and rescue personnel receive
special training to deal with the higher voltages and chemicals
encountered in electric and hybrid electric vehicle accidents. While BEV
accidents may present unusual problems, such as fires and fumes
resulting from rapid battery discharge, there is apparently no available
information regarding whether they are inherently more or less dangerous
than gasoline or diesel internal combustion vehicles which carry
flammable fuels.

### Future

The future of battery electric vehicles depends primarily upon the cost
and availability of [batteries](/wiki/Rechargeable_battery "wikilink") with
high energy densities, power density, and long life, as all other
aspects such as motors, motor controllers, and chargers are fairly
mature and cost-competitive with internal combustion engine components.
[Li-ion](/wiki/Li-ion "wikilink"),
[Li-poly](/wiki/Lithium_ion_polymer_battery "wikilink") and [zinc-air
batteries](/wiki/Zinc-air_battery "wikilink") have demonstrated energy
densities high enough to deliver range and recharge times comparable to
conventional vehicles.

The cathodes of early 2007 lithium-ion batteries are made from
lithium-cobalt metal oxide. This material is pricey, and can release
oxygen if its cell is overcharged. If the cobalt is replaced with iron
phosphates, the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge.
The price premium for early 2007 hybrids is about US $5000, some $3000
of which is for their NiMH battery packs. At early 2007 gasoline and
electricity prices, that would break even after six to ten years of
operation. The hybrid premium could fall to $2000 in five years, with
$1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries, providing a
three-year payback.[19]

Hobbyists, conversions, and racing

<img src="NoveltyEV-1.jpg" title="fig:The Silver Sofa can spin in place and is charged by solar panels. It is intended for use at off–road events such as Burning Man" alt="The Silver Sofa can spin in place and is charged by solar panels. It is intended for use at off–road events such as Burning Man" width="200" />

Hobbyists often build their own EVs by
[converting](/wiki/Electric_vehicle_conversion "wikilink") existing production
cars to run solely on electricity. There is a [cottage
industry](cottage_industry "wikilink") supporting the conversion and
construction of BEVs by hobbyists. Universities such as the [University
of California, Irvine](/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine "wikilink") even
build their own custom electric or hybrid-electric cars from scratch.

Short-range battery electric vehicles offer the hobbyist comfort,
utility, and quickness, sacrificing only range. Short-range BEVs may be
built using high-performance lead–acid batteries, using about half the
mass needed for a 60 to 80 mile (100 to 130 km) range; the result is a
vehicle with about a thirty mile (50 km) range, which when designed with
appropriate weight distribution (40/60 front to rear) does not require
[power steering](power_steering "wikilink"), offers exceptional
acceleration in the lower end of its operating range, is freeway capable
and legal, but are expensive due to the higher cost for these
higher-performance batteries. By including a [manual
transmission](manual_transmission "wikilink"), short-range BEVs can
obtain both better performance and greater efficiency than the
single-speed BEVs developed by major manufactures. Unlike the converted
golf carts used for [neighborhood electric
vehicles](neighborhood_electric_vehicle "wikilink"), short-range BEVs
may be operated on typical suburban throughways (40 to 45 MPH or 60 or
70 km/h speed limits are typical) and can keep up with traffic typical
on such roads and the short "slow-lane" on-and-off segments of freeways
common in suburban areas.

Some drag race such conversions as members of [National Electric Drag
Racing
Association](/wiki/National_Electric_Drag_Racing_Association "wikilink")
(NEDRA). Battery electric vehicles are also very popular in quarter mile
(400 meter) racing. The NEDRA regularly holds electric car races and
often competes them successfully against exotics such as the [Dodge
Viper](/wiki/Dodge_Viper "wikilink") or [Saleen S7](Saleen_S7 "wikilink").

Japanese Professor [Hiroshi
Shimizu](/wiki/Hiroshi_Shimizu_(professor) "wikilink") from Faculty of
Environmental Information of the [Keio
University](/wiki/Keio_University "wikilink") created the limousine of the
future: the [Eliica](/wiki/Eliica "wikilink") (Electric Lithium Ion Car) has
eight wheels with electric 55 kilowatt hub motors (8WD) with an output
of 470 kilowatts and zero emissions. With a top speed of 370 kilometers
per hour, and a maximum reach of 320 kilometers provided by
lithium-ion-batteries. ([video at eliica.com](http://www.eliica.com/))
However, current models cost approximately $300,000 US, about half of
which is the cost of the batteries.

</figure>The three major US automobile manufacturers, [General
Motors](/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation "wikilink"), [Chrysler
Corporation](/wiki/Chrysler_Corporation "wikilink") and [Ford Motor
Company](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company "wikilink") have been accused by a variety
of consumer advocates, activists, commentators, journalists, and
documentary makers of deliberately [sabotaging](/wiki/Sabotage "wikilink")
their companies' BEV efforts through several methods: failing to market,
failing to produce appropriate vehicles, failing to satisfy demand, and
using lease-only programs with prohibitions against end of lease
purchase. By these actions they have managed to terminate their BEV
development and marketing programs despite operators' offers of purchase
and assumption of maintenance liabilities. The Chrysler "golf cart"
program has seemed to some as an insult to the marketplace and to
government mandates; Chrysler has been accused of intentionally failing
to produce a vehicle usable in mixed traffic conditions. Moreover, the
three major American motor companies have almost exclusively promoted
their electric cars in the American market, where gas has been
comparatively cheap, and virtually ignored the European market, where
gas is significantly more expensive.

The manufacturers, in their defense, have responded that they only make
what the public wants. At the end of their programs GM destroyed its BEV
fleet, despite offers to purchase from drivers. Ford's Norwegian-built
"Th!nk" fleet was covered by a three-year exemption to the standard US
motor vehicle safety laws, after which time Ford had planned to
dismantle and recycle its fleet. However, Ford was persuaded by
activists to refrain from destroying its fleet and return them to Norway
and sell them as used vehicles. Ford also sold a few lead-acid battery
[Ranger EVs](/wiki/Ford_Ranger_EV "wikilink"), and some fleet purchase
Chevrolet S-10 EV pickups are being refurbished and sold on the
secondary market.

Critics have pointed out that General Motors' customer survey highlights
the company's efforts to lower demand. GM called interested customers
and emphasized negative characteristics disputed by EV1 drivers. CARB
removed their zero emission regulations in part because such surveys
purported to show that no demand existed for the EV1s.

Both Honda and Toyota also manufactured BEVs. Honda followed the lead of
the other majors and terminated their lease-only programs, completely
destroying their fleet and its components by shredding. Toyota offered
vehicles for both sale and lease. While Toyota has terminated
manufacture of new vehicles, it continues to support those manufactured.
A small number of [Toyota RAV4 EVs](/wiki/Toyota_RAV4_EV "wikilink") are still
on the road.

Oil companies have been accused of using patent protection to keep
modern battery technology from use in
BEVs[4](http://www.evworld.com/blogs/index.cfm?page=blogentry&authorid=51&blogid=104&archive=1).

A film on the subject, directed by former EV1 owner and activist Chris
Paine, entitled *[Who Killed the Electric
Car?](/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car? "wikilink")* premiered at the
[Sundance Film Festival](/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival "wikilink") and at the
[Tribeca Film Festival](/wiki/Tribeca_Film_Festival "wikilink") in 2006, and
was released July 2006.

### Proponents' arguments

Supporters point out the following:

-   BEVs reduce dependence on oil.
-   BEVs reduce dependence on price manipulated oil markets.
-   BEVs reduce vehicle energy costs by up to 90%
-   BEVs are up to 75% energy efficient (with ReGen) VS as little as 15%
    for a petrol ICE powered car (inc. transmission losses)
-   BEVs have much more torque than an ICE (for a given power rating)
    and a flat torque curve.
-   BEVs mitigate [global warming](global_warming "wikilink").
-   BEVs are quieter than internal combustion engine vehicles (Though in
    the newest ICE vehicles engines only account for a small fraction of
    the noise; most noise is produced by tires and aerodynamics in an
    equal measure as BEVs).
-   BEVs do not produce noxious fumes.
-   BEVs can readily satisfy the needs for short trips and up to 500 km
    with Li-Ion and regeneration.
-   Home recharging is more convenient than trips to gasoline stations.
    If combined with green home energy or devices like Honda's Home
    Energy Station (which uses hydrogen to produce electricity) BEVs can
    truly be considered emission-free.
-   Regenerative braking can significantly improve vehicle efficiency.
-   Recharging costs are more predictable than gas prices, and not
    subject to volatile international incidents.
-   Maintenance such as oil changes, smog inspections (and their
    sometimes expensive consequences), cooling fluid replacement, and
    periodic repair and adjustments are reduced or completely
    eliminated, significantly reducing the cost of ownership.
-   BEVs can be powered indirectly by home
    [photovoltaics](solar_cell "wikilink") using [net
    metering](net_metering "wikilink"), which offers advantages to both
    power producers and other grid users through peak demand
    satisfaction and to the EV user through cost reduction and load
    balancing, especially with time of use net metering.
-   BEVs can provide power to a home in the case of a power outage if
    specially equipped.
-   Even if powered by electricity from polluting coal plants, they are
    still far more energy efficient than gasoline-powered cars.
-   In case of an accident or during refueling no need to be worried
    about burning or exploding gasoline.
-   BEVs are favorable to [hydrogen
    vehicles](hydrogen_vehicle "wikilink") because there is no need to
    invest in a large scale system of hydrogen distribution/storage, and
    BEVs have a significantly higher energy conversion efficiency than
    hydrogen electrolization cycles. The electricity distribution system
    is already in place.

The greatest supporters of BEVs are often those who have obtained or
built and used them. This is a self-selected group because BEVs have not
been promoted by the major manufacturers in the United States, so their
enthusiasm may be misleading.

### Detractors' arguments

Skeptics of the viability of BEVs argue on conventional practicality
grounds and in more general terms. Practicality grounds include:

-   Electricity is produced using such methods as [nuclear
    fission](nuclear_fission "wikilink"), with its attendant regulatory
    and waste issues, or (more often) by burning coal, the latter
    producing about 0.97 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> (2.1 pounds) per
    kilowatt-hour[5](http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/01-02/RE_info/C02.htm)
    plus other pollutants and strip-mining damages: electric vehicles
    are therefore not "zero emissions" in any real-world sense, except
    at their point of use unless [renewable
    energy](renewable_energy "wikilink") (solar, wind, wave, tidal,
    geothermal, or hydro power) is employed;
-   Zero emission electrical sources such as solar panels must still be
    manufactured, producing various pollutants.
-   Limited driving [range](range "wikilink") available between
    recharging (using certain battery technologies)
-   Expensive batteries, which may cost US$2,000 (lead acid) to $20,000
    (li-ion) to replace; most real EV cars do not get 20,000 miles
    (32,000 km) from a set of batteries due to low miles per day,
    therefore the cost per mile can be 20 to 30 cents more than gasoline
    cars due to battery replacement in a limited number of cases.
-   Poor cold weather performance of some kinds of batteries.
-   Danger of electrocution and electromagnetic interference.
-   Poor availability of public charging stations reduces practicality
    and may hinder initial take-up. People who live in flats or houses
    without private parking may not have an option to charge the vehicle
    at home.
-   Pedestrians are less aware of quiet vehicles, and are more likely to
    collide with them.

Those arguing in more general terms ponder the [future of the
car](future_of_the_car "wikilink") as a transport solution for even more
widespread global adoption, noting that the issues of traffic jams,
noise pollution, total life-cycle pollution, land use, road fatalities,
energy expenditure, as well as the health toll resulting from a
sedentary lifestyle, will not be solved by zero-emission vehicles.

It can also be argued that the current state of the automobile industry
is simply experiencing a shift due to superseding technologies, as was
the case when the automobile drove the production of horse-drawn
carriages, saddles, and buggy-whips into obscurity. Future automobiles
will thus shift toward low-cost and low-maintenance items, compared to
today.
