EVProduction.org is dedicated to collaboration regarding various
projects to bring a viable battery-powered electric vehicle into mass
production in the United States. Ideas discussed on these pages are
"open source" - there are no secrets here.

[Jerry Dycus](/wiki/Jerry_Dycus "wikilink") plans to put the [Freedom
EV](/wiki/Freedom_EV "wikilink") into production, so most of the activity is
around this vehicle right now.
