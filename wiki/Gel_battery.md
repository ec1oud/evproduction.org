A **gel battery** is a rechargeable [valve regulated](/wiki/VRLA "wikilink")
[lead-acid battery](lead-acid_battery "wikilink") with a
[gelified](gel "wikilink") [electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink"). Unlike
a traditional wet-cell lead-acid battery, these batteries do not need to
be kept upright (though they cannot be charged inverted). In addition,
gel batteries virtually eliminate the electrolyte evaporation, spillage
(and subsequent [corrosion](corrosion "wikilink") issues) common to the
wet-cell battery, and boast greater resistance to extreme temperatures,
shock, and vibration. As a result, they are primarily used in
automobiles, boats, aircraft, and other motorized vehicles. These
batteries are often colloquially referred to as sealed lead-acid (SLA)
batteries due to their non-leaking containers, but they are not
completely sealed; the valve regulation system allows for gas to be
expelled. Chemically they are the same as wet (non sealed) batteries
except that the antimony in the lead plates is replaced by calcium. This
preserves the mechanical characteristics but renders the construction
far less prone to gassing. The battery type is often referred to as a
Lead-Calcium battery.

At high currents, [electrolysis of
water](electrolysis_of_water "wikilink") occurs, expelling
[Hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen "wikilink") and [Oxygen](Oxygen "wikilink") gas
through the battery's valves. Care must be taken to prevent short
circuits and rapid charging. Charging with a constant voltage (called
the float charge voltage; 2.26Â V per cell for a lead-acid chemistry) can
cause a rapid initial current, so therefore it is suggested to begin
with a constant current, using constant voltage only for the final
portion of the charging. However, the float charge voltage should not be
exceeded by much for typical usage, so the switch between the two modes
typically occurs when the float voltage is needed to sustain the
charging current through the battery's internal resistance (as per
[Ohm's Law](/wiki/Ohm's_Law "wikilink")). The easiest way to implement this is
to use a constant voltage device with a current limiter.
