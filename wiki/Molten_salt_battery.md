**Molten salt batteries** are a class of [primary
cell](primary_cell "wikilink") and [secondary
cell](secondary_cell "wikilink") high temperature [electric
battery](electric_battery "wikilink") that use molten salts as an
electrolyte. They offer both a higher energy density through the proper
selection of reactant pairs as well as a higher power density by means
of a high [conductivity](/wiki/Electrical_conductivity "wikilink") molten
[salt](salt "wikilink") [electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink"). They are
used in services where high [energy density](energy_density "wikilink")
and high [power density](power_density "wikilink") are required. These
features make rechargeable molten salt batteries a promising technology
for powering [electric vehicles](electric_vehicle "wikilink"). Operating
temperatures of 400 to 700°C however bring problems of thermal
management and safety and places more stringent requirements on the rest
of the battery components.

Primary cells
-------------

Referred to as **thermal batteries** the electrolyte is solid and
inactive at normal ambient temperatures. In these batteries the
electrolyte is usually stored separately from the
[electrodes](electrode "wikilink") which also remain in a dry inactive
state. The battery is only activated when it is actually needed by
introducing the electrolyte into the active cell area and elevated to
high temperatures by the application of heat from an external source,
generally a [pyrotechnic](pyrotechnic "wikilink") charge. This is
achieved by burning electrically fired pellets of gas-less
[thermite](thermite "wikilink"). Activation takes between 0.2 second and
a few seconds, depending on the size of the stack, and is initiated by a
[percussive primer](/wiki/Percussion_cap "wikilink"). Other methods use an
[electric heater](electric_heater "wikilink"), or a pyroelectric
material, like [iron powder](/wiki/Iron "wikilink") [potassium
perchlorate](potassium_perchlorate "wikilink")/[zirconium](zirconium "wikilink")
[barium chromate](barium_chromate "wikilink") placed between the cells
in the battery to obtain the required temperature.

This property of unactivated storage has the double benefit of avoiding
deterioration of the active materials during storage and at the same
time it eliminates the loss of capacity due to self discharge until the
battery is called into use. They can thus be stored indefinitely yet
provide full power in an instant when it is required. Activated they
provide a high burst of power for a short period (A few tens of seconds
to 20 minutes or more.) with power output ranges from a few
[watts](watt "wikilink") to several [kilowatts](kilowatt "wikilink").
Older batteries used [calcium](calcium "wikilink") or
[magnesium](magnesium "wikilink") [anodes](anode "wikilink"), but
[lithium](lithium "wikilink") anodes are now common. Typical chemistry
is [lithium iron disulphide](lithium_iron_disulphide "wikilink"). The
electrolyte is normally a eutectic mixture of lithium and [potassium
chlorides](potassium_chloride "wikilink").

These batteries are used almost exclusively for military applications.

Secondary cells
---------------

Since the mid 1960s much development work has been undertaken on
rechargeable batteries using [sodium](sodium "wikilink") (Na) for the
[negative](negative "wikilink") [electrodes](electrode "wikilink").
Sodium is attractive because of its high [reduction
potential](reduction_potential "wikilink") of -2.71
[volts](volt "wikilink"), its low weight, its non toxic nature, its
relative abundance and ready availability and its low cost. In order to
construct practical batteries the sodium must be used in liquid form.
Since the [melting point](melting_point "wikilink") of sodium is 98°C
this means that sodium based batteries must operate at high
temperatures, typically in excess of 270°C.

Sodium/sulfur and lithium/sulfur batteries comprise two of the more
advanced systems of the molten salt batteries. The [NaS
battery](/wiki/NaS_battery "wikilink") has reached a more advanced
developmental stage than its lithium counterpart; it is more attractive
since it employs cheap and abundant electrode materials. Thus the first
commercial battery produced was the Sodium/Sulphur battery which used
liquid [sulphur](sulphur "wikilink") for the positive electrode and a
[ceramic](ceramic "wikilink") tube of [beta-alumina solid
electrolyte](beta-alumina_solid_electrolyte "wikilink") (BASE) for the
electrolyte. Corrosion of the insulators was found to be a problem in
the harsh chemical environment as they gradually became conductive and
the self-discharge rate increased. A further problem of
[dendritic-sodium](dendrites "wikilink") growth in Na/S batteries led to
the development of the zebra battery.

The **zebra battery**, which operates at 250°C, utilizes molten
chloroaluminate, (NaAlCl<sub>4</sub>) which has a melting point of
approximately 160°C, as the electrolyte. The negative electrode is
molten sodium. The positive electrode is [nickel](nickel "wikilink") in
the discharged state and [nickel chloride](nickel_chloride "wikilink")
in the charged state. Because nickel and nickel chloride are nearly
[insoluble](insoluble "wikilink") in neutral and
[basic](/wiki/Alkaline "wikilink") melts, intimate contact is allowed,
providing little [resistance](/wiki/Electrical_resistance "wikilink") to
charge transfer. Since both NaAlCl<sub>4</sub> and Na are liquid at the
operating temperature, a sodium-conducting beta-alumina ceramic is used
to separate the liquid sodium from the molten NaAlCl<sub>4</sub>. This
battery was invented in 1985 by a group led by Dr. Johan Coetzer at the
[CSIR](/wiki/CSIR "wikilink") in [Pretoria, South
Africa](/wiki/Pretoria,_South_Africa "wikilink"), hence the name zebra battery
(for the Zeolite Battery Research Africa Project), has been under
development for almost 20 years. The technical name for the battery is
Na-NiCl<sub>2</sub> battery.

The ZEBRA battery has an attractive specific energy and power (90 Wh/kg
and 150 W/kg). The liquid electrolyte freezes at 157 C, and the normal
operating temperature range is 270–350 C. The β-alumina solid
electrolyte that has been developed for this system is very stable, both
to sodium metal and the sodium chloroaluminate. Lifetimes of over 1500
cycles and five years have been demonstrated with full-sized batteries,
and over 3000 cycles and eight years with 10- and 20-cell modules.
Vehicles powered by ZEBRA batteries have covered more than 2 million km.

When not in use, zebra batteries typically require being left under
charge, in order to be ready for use when needed. If shut down, a
reheating process must be initiated that may require up to two days to
restore the battery pack to the desired temperature, and full charge.
This reheating time will however vary depending on the state-of-charge
of the batteries at the time of their shut down, battery-pack
temperature, and power available for reheating. After a full shut down
of the battery pack, three to four days usually elapse before a
fully-charged battery pack loses all of its significant heat.
