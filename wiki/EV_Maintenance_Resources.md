The following area is intended to be an archive of information valuable
to the design and maintenance of EV's.

I would hope to get links to resources like existing designs for battery
balancers, charging algorithms, battery charger controllers. Designs not
necessarily for the Freedom EV, but of value to the EV community in
general.

Battery care and Maintenance
----------------------------

[Battery monitoring/management
systems](/wiki/Battery_monitoring/management_systems "wikilink") Hawker put
out a [useful guide for the general care of lead acid
batteries](http://aaron.boim.com/EV/EVhandbook4hawkerBatteries.pdf).

They also have some [other battery
guides](http://aaron.boim.com/EV/Hawker_BatteryApplicationHandbook.pdf).
Even information for the [charging of lead-tin
batteries](http://aaron.boim.com/EV/Hawker_ChargingLead-Tin_Batteries.pdf).

NREL published a paper on an [interrupt charging
algorithm](http://crow/~aaron/EV/InteruptChargingAlgorithm.pdf) for
lead-acid batteries.

Data Communications
-------------------

I don't know much about CAN. I guess there are some barriers to
use/entry of this automotive data bus for home-build EVs. Lee Hart has
published his design for a data communication bus for use in EV's, where
there is a lot of noise, and great need for isolation. Here is the
[schematic for converting EViLBus to
RS232](http://aaron.boim.com/EV/RS232toEVILbus.gif).
