The following area is intended to be an archive of information valuable
to the design and maintenance of EV's.

I would hope to get links to resources like existing designs for battery
balancers, charging algorithms, battery charger controllers. Designs not
necessarily for the Freedom EV, but of value to the EV community in
general.

The [Enabling technologies](/wiki/Enabling_technologies "wikilink") section
provides references on general EV components such as
[Batteries](/wiki/Batteries "wikilink"), [Battery monitoring/management
systems](/wiki/Battery_monitoring/management_systems "wikilink") and [Data
Communications](/wiki/Data_Communications "wikilink").
