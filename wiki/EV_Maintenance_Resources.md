The following area is intended to be an archive of information valuable
to the design and maintenance of EV's.

I would hope to get links to resources like existing designs for battery
balancers, charging algorithms, battery charger controllers. Designs not
necessarily for the Freedom EV, but of value to the EV community in
general.

Battery care and Maintenance
----------------------------

Hawker put out a [useful guide for the general care of lead acid
batteries](http://aaron.boim.com/EV/EVhandbook4hawkerBatteries.pdf).

They also have some [other battery
guides](http://aaron.boim.com/EV/Hawker_BatteryApplicationHandbook.pdf).
Even information for the [charging of lead-tin
batteries](http://aaron.boim.com/EV/Hawker_ChargingLead-Tin_Batteries.pdf).

NREL published a paper on an [interrupt charging
algorithm](http://crow/~aaron/EV/InteruptChargingAlgorithm.pdf) for
lead-acid batteries.

Lee Hart did a very complete battery balancer design some years ago. I
hope that he will edit this page to link to his "official" resources. He
has been free with the information in the past, so in the interest of
getting a "Lee Hart Balancer" section started in this Wiki, here are
some [schematics for the Lee Hart
Balancer](http://aaron.boim.com/EV/LeeHartBalancer/).
