**Lithium ion polymer batteries**, or more commonly **lithium polymer
batteries** (Abbreviated Li-Poly or LiPo) are [rechargeable
batteries](rechargeable_battery "wikilink") which have technologically
evolved from [lithium ion batteries](lithium_ion_battery "wikilink").
Ultimately, the [lithium](lithium "wikilink") salt
[electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink") is not held in an [organic
solvent](organic_solvent "wikilink") as in the lithium ion design, but
in a solid [polymer](polymer "wikilink") composite such as
[polyacrylonitrile](polyacrylonitrile "wikilink"). There are many
advantages of this design over the classic lithium ion design, including
the fact that the solid polymer electrolyte is not flammable (unlike the
organic solvent that the Li-Ion [cell](electrochemical_cell "wikilink")
uses). Lithium ion polymer batteries started appearing in consumer
electronics around 1996.

Overview
--------

Cells sold today as polymer batteries have a different design from the
older lithium ion cells. Unlike lithium ion cylindrical, or prismatic
cells, which have a rigid metal case, polymer cells have a flexible,
foil-type (polymer laminate) case, but they still contain organic
solvent. The main difference between commercial polymer and lithium ion
cells is that in the latter cells, the rigid case presses the electrodes
and the separator onto each other, whereas in polymer cells this
external pressure is not required because the electrode sheets and the
separator sheets are laminated onto each other.

Since no metal battery cell casing is needed, the battery can be lighter
and it can be specifically shaped to fit the device it will power.
Because of the denser packaging without intercell spacing between
cylindrical cells and the lack of metal casing, the energy density of
Li-Poly batteries is over 20% higher than that of a classical Li-Ion
battery and approximately three times better than
[NiCd](/wiki/NiCd "wikilink") and [NiMH](NiMH "wikilink") batteries.

The voltage of a Li-Poly cell varies from about 2.7 V (discharged) to
about 4.23 V (fully charged), and Li-Poly cells have to be protected
from overcharge by limiting the applied voltage to no more than 4.235 V
per cell used in a series combination. Overcharging a Li-Poly battery
will likely result in explosion and/or fire. During discharge on load,
the load has to be removed as soon as the voltage drops below
approximately 3.0 V per cell (used in a series combination), or else the
battery will subsequently no longer accept a charge.

Early in its development, lithium polymer technology had problems with
[internal resistance](internal_resistance "wikilink"). Other challenges
include longer charge times and slower maximum discharge rates compared
to more mature technologies. Li-Po batteries typically require more than
an hour for a full charge. Recent design improvements have increased
maximum discharge currents from two times to 15 or even 30 times the
cell capacity (discharge rate in amps, cell capacity in amp-hours). In
March 2005 [Toshiba](/wiki/Toshiba "wikilink") announced a new design offering
a much faster (about 1-3 minutes) rate of charge. These cells have yet
to reach the market but should have a dramatic effect on the power tool
and [electric vehicle](electric_vehicle "wikilink") industries, and a
major effect on consumer electronics; especially electrically powered
[model aircraft](/wiki/Radio-controlled_aircraft "wikilink").

When compared to the [lithium ion
battery](lithium_ion_battery "wikilink"), Li-Poly had a greater life
cycle degradation rate. However, in recent years, manufacturers have
been declaring upwards of 500 charge-discharge cycles before the
capacity drops to 80% (see [Sanyo](/wiki/Sanyo "wikilink")). Another variant
of Li-Poly cells, the "[thin film rechargeable lithium
battery](thin_film_rechargeable_lithium_battery "wikilink")" has been
shown to provide more than 10,000 cycles.

Applications

A compelling advantage of Li-Poly is that manufacturers can shape the
battery almost however they please, which can be important to mobile
phone manufacturers constantly working on smaller, thinner, and lighter
phones. Another advantage of lithium polymer cells over nickel cadmium
and nickel metal hydride cells is that the rate of self discharge is
much lower.

Li-Poly batteries are also gaining favor in the world of
[radio-controlled aircraft](radio-controlled_aircraft "wikilink"), where
the advantages of both lower weight and greatly increased run times can
be sufficient justification for the price. However, lithium
polymer-specific chargers are required to avoid fire and explosion.
Explosions can also occur if the battery is short circuited as
tremendous current would be available for a short time. Radio control
enthusiasts take special precautions to ensure their battery leads are
properly connected and insulated. Specially designed electronic motor
speed controls are used to prevent excessive discharge and subsequent
battery damage. This is achieved using a Low Voltage Cut-off (LVC)
setting, that is adjusted to maintain cell voltage at (typically) 3v per
cell.

Li-poly batteries are also gaining ground in
[PDAs](/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant "wikilink") and [laptop
computers](laptop "wikilink"), such as
[Apple](/wiki/Apple_Computer "wikilink")'s [MacBook](MacBook "wikilink") and
small digital music devices such as [iPods](iPod "wikilink") and other
[MP3 players](/wiki/Digital_audio_player "wikilink"), as well as portable
gaming devices like the [Sony PSP](/wiki/PlayStation_Portable "wikilink") or
[Nintendo](/wiki/Nintendo "wikilink")'s [Game Boy Advance
SP](/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_SP "wikilink"), where small form factors and energy
density outweigh cost considerations.

These batteries may also power the next generation of [battery electric
vehicles](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink"). The cost of an electric
car of this type is prohibitive, but proponents argue that with
increased production, the cost of Li-Poly batteries will go down.

Canadian company BionX had been supplying electric conversion kits for
some time that used brushless motors and Nickel Metal Hydride batteries,
but during 2006, they introduced batteries that used Lithium Ion
technology. During 2007 Urban Mover and PowaCycle in the UK, introduced
the first commercially available Li-Poly powered electric bikes, as
opposed to just supplying conversion kits.

Technology
----------

There are currently two commercialized technologies, both
lithium-ion-polymer (where "polymer" stands for "polymer
electrolyte/separator"). They are called "polymer electrolyte
batteries".

The idea is to use an ion-conducting polymer instead of the traditional
combination of a microporous separator and a liquid electrolyte. This
promises not only better safety, as polymer electrolyte does not burn as
easily, but also the possibility to make battery cells very thin, as
they don't require pressure applied to "sandwich" cathode+anode
together. Polymer electrolyte seals both electrodes together like a
glue.

The design is: anode (Li or carbon-Li
[intercalation](/wiki/Intercalation_(chemistry) "wikilink")
compound)/conducting polymer electrolyte-separator/cathode
(LiCoO<sub>2</sub> or LiMnO<sub>4</sub>)

Typical reaction:

-   [Anode](/wiki/Anode "wikilink"): carbon-Li(*x*) - *x*Li+ -
    *x*e<sup>−</sup>
-   [Separator](/wiki/Separator "wikilink"): Li+ conduction
-   [Cathode](/wiki/Cathode "wikilink"): Li(1-*x*)CoO<sub>2</sub> + *x*Li+ +
    *x*e<sup>−</sup>

Polymer electrolyte/separator can be real solid polymer
([polyethyleneoxide](/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol "wikilink"), PEO) plus
LiPF<sub>6</sub> or other conducting salt plus SiO<sub>2</sub> or other
filler for better mechanical properties (such systems are not available
commercially yet). Some are planning to use metallic Li as the anode,
whereas others want to go with the proven safe carbon intercalation
anode.

Both currently commercialized technologies use
[PVdF](/wiki/Polyvinylidene_fluoride "wikilink") (a polymer) gelled with
conventional solvents and salts, like EC/DMC/DEC etc. The difference
between the two technologies is that one
([Bellcore/Telcordia](/wiki/Telcordia_Technologies "wikilink") technology)
uses [LiMnO<sub>4</sub>](lithium_permanganate "wikilink") as the
cathode, and the other, more conventional
[LiCoO<sub>2</sub>](lithium_cobalt_oxide "wikilink").

Other, more exotic (although not yet commercially available) Li-polymer
batteries use a polymer cathode. For example, Moltech is developing a
battery with a plastic conducting carbon-sulfur cathode. However, as of
2005 this technology seems to have problems with self-discharge and
manufacturing cost.

Yet another proposal is to use organic sulfur containing compounds for
the cathode in combination with an electrically conducting polymer such
as polyaniline. This approach promises high power capability (i.e. low
internal resistance) and high discharge capacity, but has problems with
cycleability and cost.
