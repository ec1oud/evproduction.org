An EV '''motor controller''' is  a device or group of devices that serves to govern in some predetermined manner the performance of a vehicle drive [[electric motor]]. A motor controller might include a manual or automatic means for starting and stopping the motor, selecting forward or reverse rotation, selecting and regulating the speed, regulating or limiting the torque, and protecting against overloads and faults.
==Vehicle applications==
All types of engine-driven vehicles from automobiles, airplanes, aircraft carriers and agricultural equipment to [[Ice resurfacer|zambonis]] may have electric motors to perform a variety of functions. In [[electric vehicles]], [[diesel-electric]] vehicles, and [[hybrid vehicles]], electric motors are used to propel the vehicle. The motor controllers in vehicle applications are integrated into the vehicle.

==Types of motor controllers==
An electric motor controller can be classified by the type of motor it is to drive such as [[permanent magnet]], [[servomechanism|servo]], series, separately excited, and [[alternating current]].

A motor controller is connected to a power source such as a battery pack or power supply, and control circuitry in the form of analog or digital input signals.

==Specific motor controller descriptions==
===H-bridge===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:H-bridge.gif|thumb|H-bridge Circuit]] -->
DC motors are typically controlled by using a transistor configuration called an "[[H-bridge]]".  This consists of a minimum of four mechanical or solid-state switches, such as two NPN and two PNP transistors.  One NPN and one PNP transistor are activated at a time.  Both NPN or PNP transistors can be activated to cause a short across the motor terminals, which can be useful for slowing down the motor from the back [[electromotive force|EMF]] it creates.

===Servo controllers===
Most [[servomechanism|servos]] are controlled using [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM).  How long the pulse remains high (typically between 1 and 2 milliseconds) determines where the motor will try to position itself.  The controller must know the motor's position in order to know how to move it. To find the position of the motor some designs use [[Hall effect sensor]]s to directly measure the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]]'s position. Others measure the back [[electromotive force|EMF]] in the undriven coils to infer the rotor position, eliminating the need for separate Hall effect sensors, and therefore are often called "sensorless" controllers.  A [[potentiometer|variable resistor]] can also be used to determine the motor's position.

===Stepper motor controllers===
Stepper motors are moved by rotating which coil to apply electricity to in a circular manner.  They are controlled by a timing circuit.  This allows extremely accurate control by changing the clock speed for the next firing.  Typically these are used in printers where precise positioning is necessary and must be done in the cheapest way possible.
