At the beginning of the 20th century, as the "horseless carriage" was being developed, there were 3 favored options for propulsion:  a steam engine (like the trains of the era), an internal combustion engine, or an [[electric motor]].  Women tended to prefer electric cars because they were clean and didn't require cranking the engine over by hand; while the men often preferred the gasoline-powered engine.  And gasoline was incredibly cheap then, even when you account for inflation.  It was a byproduct from the oil refineries which did not have many uses, and in some cases was simply discarded by dumping it on the ground.

Now in the 21st century, with crude oil prices setting new records periodically, and our newfound concern about the [[global warming]] which we may have wrought upon this world, and the smog in our cities which changes local weather patterns and affects the health of everyone, it is becoming increasingly clear that gasoline and other petroleum products must eventually be obsolete.  Economic forces will soon push us willy-nilly toward any other option that we can grasp, as the supply is no longer keeping up with the demand of so many people who all want their own wheels.  We expect to face this change within our own lifetimes.

Many people do not believe that electric cars could possibly be a practical alternative, simply because the first image that pops into their minds is probably the humble [[golf cart]] or a vehicle with a short range.  And the government, always subject to the influence of lobbyists with ulterior motives, is telling us that hydrogen is the fuel of the future; even though there is no obvious source for so much hydrogen, to satiate the appetite of Americans for fast transportation, even if we leave the rest of the world to its own devices.  The thing is, while they dream up this pie-in-the-sky future and make plans that will take decades to materialize (at least until that idea falls out of vogue again), it's been possible for many decades already to build an electric car that will go down the freeway just as well as the gas-powered ones, and will handle your daily commute and errands reliably.  What was possible in the early 20th century has improved since then, just as gas-powered engines have evolved.

Because computers have become commonplace and cheap, and there are so many skilled programmers, an idea called "open source", including [[open source hardware]], has taken off exponentially in the past decade.  The most creative programmers are pooling their spare time to write free programs and operating systems, which anyone can use, and anyone can fix problems, or make improvements, and give those changes to the world.  If you are reading this page with the [http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/ Firefox] browser or uses [[wikipedia:Linux|Linux]], then you are already benefitting from the open source movement.  And for almost every other task as well, some free software is available.

We think the time is right for the electric [[open source vehicle]].  It will be a car for the people which is built by the people, and keeps up with the traffic of the rest of the people on the freeway.

On these pages we aim to detail exactly how it's possible.  So read on, and keep in mind that your ideas matter too, and we want to hear about them!  We invite you to change and improve every page, and to write your own dreams.  If we work together, maybe all our wishes can be fulfilled.

== EVProduction club == 

The EVProduction club began life as a [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVProduction/ Yahoo mailing list]. The current plan is to collect dues from members to fund the club's projects.

This group is for the purpose of getting BEV's into production by group effort. The auto companies will not do it so we must do it ourselves. We intend to enable start up of [[wikipedia:open hardware|open hardware]] EV production lines and standards of several types of EV's done by group vote with money raised by the group. 

These could be either proposals by people to the group or by the group designing the EV's and putting it out to bid to be built in whatever manner the group decides. 

There will be dues as decided by the elected board and once an EV plan is decided, production slots will be first deposit, first unit basis.

By spreading the costs amoung many we can keep the risk very low and with our experience in EV's do them right.

The EVProduction club is for those who want EV's on the market and willing to help make it happen.

==Our first car, the Freedom EV==

Want to break free from nuclear-[[oil dependence]], but continue to experience the freedom of the open highway?  Want to keep your free time to yourself, not spend too much of it building your own car?  The [[Freedom EV]] is going to be one of your best choices.  [[Jerry Dycus]] is setting up production of these, and has some great momentum going.  It's a grassroots project, no big capitalist financing involved, which means that for now it's a kit car.  As the momentum builds, Jerry plans to get the bodies into larger-scale production, and eventually to sell finished cars.  [[EVProduction:Community Portal|A few others]] are hashing out some of the other details.

One can use [[OSCar]] as a base to develop a greener car, the Freedom EV.

The traditional way to get your own electric car has been to buy a used car, remove the engine, replace it with an electric motor, and add batteries.  (To optimize the range, you typically want about half the gross weight to be batteries.)  It began to be a popular idea during the energy crisis in the 1970's, but is still being done today.  The advantage of this approach is that it's fairly direct, and many fairly ambitious back-yard mechanics are capable of doing it.  The trouble is that the car was not designed to be electric, and most such cars will not perform as well as one that is designed for it.

One can use also a [[glider]] and install an EV motor.
