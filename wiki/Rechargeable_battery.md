battery.](Nokia_Battery_Hologram.jpg "fig:A rechargeable lithium polymer Nokia mobile phone battery.")
**Rechargeable batteries**, also known as **storage batteries** or
**[secondary cells](secondary_cell "wikilink")**, are
[batteries](battery_(electricity) "wikilink") that can be restored to
full charge by the application of [electrical
energy](electrical_energy "wikilink"). They are also called accu/akku,
which is short for accumulator. They come in many different designs
using different chemicals. Attempting to recharge non-rechargeable
batteries is not advised as it has a small chance of causing a [battery
explosion](/wiki/Battery_explosion#Battery_explosion "wikilink"). Some types
of rechargeable batteries are susceptible to damage due to [reverse
charging](/wiki/Rechargeable_battery#Reverse_charging "wikilink") if they are
fully discharged; other types need to be fully discharged occasionally
in order to maintain the capacity for deep discharge. Fully integrated
[battery chargers](battery_charger "wikilink") that optimize the
charging current are available.

Rechargeable batteries currently are used for lower power applications
such as automobile starters, portable consumer devices, tools, and
[uninterruptible power
supplies](uninterruptible_power_supply "wikilink"). Emerging
applications in [hybrid
vehicles](petroleum_electric_hybrid_vehicle "wikilink") and [electric
vehicles](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") are driving the
technology to improve cost, reduce weight, and increase lifetime. Future
applications are proposed to use rechargeable batteries for load
leveling, where they would store baseline electric power for use during
peak load periods, and for [renewable
energy](renewable_energy "wikilink") uses, such as storing power
generated from [photovoltaic arrays](photovoltaic_array "wikilink")
during the day to be used at night.

Battery types
-------------

### Nickel-iron

The Nickel-iron battery is a very robust battery which is tolerant of
mistreatment, like overcharge, overdischarge, short-circuiting and
thermal shock, and can have very long life. It is often used in backup
situations where it can be continuously charged and can last for 20-50
years. [1] [2][3] Its limitations are a low [specific
energy](specific_energy "wikilink"), poor charge retention, poor
low-temperature performance and its high cost of manufacture. Its
chemical composition is nickel(III) oxide-hydroxide for the
[cathode](cathode "wikilink"), iron for the [anode](anode "wikilink"),
and [potassium hydroxide](potassium_hydroxide "wikilink") for the
[electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink"). This battery chemistry has been
produced since 1903.

### Lead

#### Wet lead acid

Wet lead acid battery: The major advantage of the [wet
cell](wet_cell "wikilink") lead acid battery is its low cost[4] - a
large battery (e.g. 70 Ah) is relatively cheap when compared to other
chemistries. However, this battery chemistry has lower [energy
density](energy_density "wikilink") than other battery chemistries
available today. Its most common application is a [starter
battery](car_battery "wikilink") for vehicles, but they can also be used
in alarm systems, [uninterruptible power
supplies](uninterruptible_power_supply "wikilink") and for energy
storage for buildings not connected to the electrical grid. The
lead-acid battery chemistry was invented in 1859.

#### Gel

![A gel battery](Bleigelakku.jpg "fig:A gel battery") Gel battery: A
type of [VRLA](/wiki/VRLA "wikilink") battery that uses gelified electrolyte.
Unlike a traditional wet cell lead-acid battery, the cells of a gel
battery are valve-regulated. Its applications include automobiles,
motorcycle, boats, aircraft, and other motorized vehicles.

#### Absorbed glass mat

Absorbed glass mat: A type of [VRLA](/wiki/VRLA "wikilink") battery. The
plates in an AGM battery may be flat like wet cell lead-acid batteries,
or they may be wound in tight spirals. In cylindrical AGM's, the plates
are thin and wound, like most consumer disposable and rechargeable
cells, into spirals so they are also sometimes referred to as spiral
wound. Its chemical composition are electrolytes absorbed into a
fiberglass mat.

### Nickel-cadmium

Nickel-cadmium battery: This chemistry gives the longest cycle life of
any currently available battery (over 1,500 cycles), but has low energy
density compared with some of the other chemistries. Batteries using
older technology suffer from [memory effect](memory_effect "wikilink"),
but this has been reduced drastically in modern batteries.
[Cadmium](/wiki/Cadmium "wikilink") is toxic to most life forms, so it poses
environmental concerns. Its chemical composition is
[nickel](nickel "wikilink") for the cathode and cadmium for the anode.
It is used in many domestic applications, but is being superseded by
Li-ion and Ni-MH types. It has been mass produced since 1946.

### Nickel metal hydride

Nickel metal hydride battery: Similar to a [nickel-cadmium
battery](nickel-cadmium_battery "wikilink") (NiCd) in that it also uses
nickel for the cathode but it uses a [hydride](hydride "wikilink")
absorbing [alloy](alloy "wikilink") for the anode. This makes it less
detrimental to the environment. In addition, a NiMH battery can have two
to three times the capacity of an equivalent size NiCd and the [memory
effect](memory_effect "wikilink") is not as significant. However,
compared with lithium ion chemistry, the volumetric energy density is
lower and self-discharge is higher. Applications for the battery include
hybrid vehicles such as the [Toyota Prius](/wiki/Toyota_Prius "wikilink"),
Toyota RAV4-EV all-electric plug-in Electric car, and consumer
electronics. It was made available in 1983. The most advanced versions,
up to 105 amp-hours, were made by a partnership between Panasonic and
Toyota. These are the standard battery for all-electric EVs capable of
lasting longer than the life of the vehicle while yielding a range more
than 100 miles on a charge, adequate acceleration, and modest weight.

### Lithium ion

Lithium ion battery: A relatively modern battery chemistry that offers a
very high charge density (i.e. a light battery will store a lot of
energy) and which does not suffer from any [memory
effect](memory_effect "wikilink") whatsoever. Its chemical composition
is LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2</sub>
or Li-Ph for the cathode and [carbon](carbon "wikilink") for the anode.
Applications include [laptop computers](laptop_computer "wikilink"),
[camera phones](camera_phone "wikilink"), some rechargeable [MP3
players](/wiki/MP3_player "wikilink"), and most other portable, rechargeable
digital equipment. [Tesla](/wiki/Tesla_Motors "wikilink"),
[Reva](/wiki/REVA "wikilink") and [Kewet](Kewet "wikilink") are all releasing
new lithium ion battery electric car models in 2007. Lithium ion
batteries were introduced around 1990. The problems with Lithium
batteries include volatility, thermal runaway, high cost, and limited
shelf and cycle life.

### Lithium ion polymer

Lithium ion polymer battery: Similar characteristics to lithium-ion, but
with slightly less [charge density](charge_density "wikilink") and a
greater life cycle degradation rate. An advantage over regular
lithium-ion is ultra-slim design, as little as 1 mm thick. Disadvantages
would be if the battery discharges below a certain voltage it may never
be able to hold a charge again, also if overcharged the battery becomes
extremely unstable and may explode. Applications include ultra-slim
cells for [personal digital
assistants](personal_digital_assistant "wikilink") (PDA). They were
released in 1996.

### Sodium-sulfur

Sodium-sulfur battery: Exhibits a high energy density, high efficiency
of charge/discharge (89—92%), long cycle life, and is made from
inexpensive, non-toxic materials. However, the operating temperature of
300 to 350 °C and the highly corrosive nature of sodium make it suitable
only for large-scale non-mobile applications. A suggested application is
grid energy storage in the electric grid.

### Nickel-zinc

Nickel-zinc battery: A type of rechargeable battery commonly used in the
light [electric vehicle](electric_vehicle "wikilink") sector. The
battery is still not commonly found in the mass market, but they are
considered as the next generation batteries used for high drain
applications, and are expected to replace lead-acid batteries because of
their higher energy density and higher power to mass ratio, up to 75%
lighter for the same power. In addition they are expected to be priced
somewhere in between [nickel-cadmium](nickel-cadmium_battery "wikilink")
and [lead-acid batteries](lead-acid_battery "wikilink"), but have twice
the energy storing capacity of nickel-cadmium batteries. Problems with
Nickel-zinc include relatively high cost with limited life expectancy.

### Molten salt

Molten salt battery: High\* temperature battery that offers both a
higher energy density through the proper selection of reactant pairs as
well as a higher power density by means of a high conductivity molten
[salt](salt "wikilink") electrolyte. They are used in services where
high energy density and high power density are required. These features
make rechargeable molten salt batteries the most promising batteries for
powering electric vehicles. However, operating temperatures of 400 to
700°C bring problems with thermal management and safety, and places more
stringent requirements on the rest of the battery components. Its
composition includes a molten salt electrolyte.

### Super iron

Super iron battery: A new class of rechargeable electric battery.
"Super-iron" is a moniker for a special kind of ferrate salt (iron(VI)):
[potassium ferrate](potassium_ferrate "wikilink") or [barium
ferrate](barium_ferrate "wikilink"), as used in this new class of
batteries.[5] As of 2004, chemist [Stuart
Licht](/wiki/Stuart_Licht "wikilink") of the University of Massachusetts in
Boston was leading research into a Super-iron battery.

### Zinc-bromine flow

Zinc bromide battery: A type of hybrid [flow
battery](flow_battery "wikilink"). A solution of [zinc
bromide](zinc_bromide "wikilink") is stored in two tanks. When the
battery is charged or discharged the electrolytes are pumped through a
reactor and back into the tanks. One tank is used to store the
electrolyte for the positive electrode reactions and the other for the
negative. Its composition includes the **zinc bromide electrolyte**.

### Rechargeable alkaline

Rechargeable alkaline battery: A variety of [alkaline
battery](alkaline_battery "wikilink") that can be recharged. It was
first released in 1993, but is now out of production in most parts of
the world. It is still being sold in Canada under the brand Pure Energy.

Recharging
----------

![Battery charger](Charger.jpg "Battery charger")

The energy used to recharge rechargeable batteries mostly comes from
[mains electricity](mains_electricity "wikilink") using an adapter unit.

Recharging backup batteries using off-peak energy paid for by on-peak
excess electric power from residential [solar
panels](solar_panels "wikilink") exactly matches the critical peak
shortage and nighly electric surplus. This load-leveling function helps
elminate the need for expensive peaker units and helps amortize the cost
of generators over more hours of operation.

Recharging from the 12V battery of a car is also possible. Use of a
[hand generator](/wiki/Electrical_generator "wikilink") is also possible, but
it is not clear if such devices are commercially made.

Most [battery chargers](battery_charger "wikilink") take several hours
to recharge a battery. Most batteries can be charged in far less time
than the most common simple battery chargers are capable of.
[Duracell](/wiki/Duracell "wikilink") now sells a charger that can recharge
AA- and AAA-size NiMH batteries in just 15 minutes.

Dynamos
-------

For uses like [radios](clockwork_radio "wikilink") and
[flashlights](flashlight "wikilink"), rechargeable batteries may be
replaced by clockwork mechanisms or
[dynamos](electrical_generator "wikilink").

### Recharging battery electric vehicles

Recharging an EV using off-peak energy paid for by on-peak excess
electric power from residential [solar panels](solar_panels "wikilink")
exactly matches the critical peak shortage and nighly electric surplus.

While EVs can charge slowly at night, raising the nightly low electric
use, solar panels can lower the daytime peak, flattening the daily usage
curve and lowering the cost of electric power for all users.

Reverse charging
----------------

Reverse charging is when a rechargeable battery is recharged with its
[polarity](polarity "wikilink") reversed. Reverse charging can occur
under a number of circumstances, the two most important being:

-   When a battery is incorrectly inserted into a
    [charger](battery_charger "wikilink").
-   When multiple batteries are used in
    [series](series_and_parallel_circuits "wikilink") in a device. When
    one battery completely discharges ahead of the rest, the other
    batteries in series may force the discharged battery to discharge to
    below zero voltage.

It can cause damage to the battery.
