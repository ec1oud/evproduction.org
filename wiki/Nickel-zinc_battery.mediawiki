The '''nickel-zinc battery''' (sometimes abbreviated '''NiZn''') is a type of [[rechargeable battery]] commonly used in the light [[electric vehicle]] sector.  

It was invented by an [[Irish people|Irish]] chemist, Dr [[James J. Drumm]] (1897-1974)<ref>[[http://www.ul.ie/~childsp/CinA/Issue46/fam_chem.html Famous Irish Chemists: James J. Drumm]</ref> and installed in a [[railcar]] in 1932 for use on the [[Dublin]]-[[Bray]] line.  It was apparently successful and it is not known why the idea was not further developed at the time.

The battery is still not commonly found in the [[mass market]], but they are considered as the next generation batteries used for high drain applications, and is expected to replace [[lead-acid batteries]] because of their higher energy to mass ratio and higher power to mass ratio (up to 75% lighter for the same power), and are relatively cheap compared to [[nickel-cadmium batteries]] (expected to be priced somewhere in between NiCd and lead-acids, but have twice the energy storing capacity).<br />
