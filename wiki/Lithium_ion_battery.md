**Lithium-ion batteries** (sometimes abbreviated **Li-ion batteries**)
are a type of [rechargeable battery](rechargeable_battery "wikilink")
commonly used in consumer electronics. They are currently one of the
most popular types of battery for portable electronics, with one of the
best energy-to-weight ratios, no [memory
effect](memory_effect "wikilink") and a slow loss of charge when not in
use. They can be dangerous if mistreated, however, and unless care is
taken their lifespan may be reduced. A more advanced lithium-ion battery
design is the [lithium polymer cell](lithium_polymer_cell "wikilink").
Although originally intended for consumer electronics, Lithium-ion
batteries are growing in popularity with the defense and aerospace
industries because of their high energy density.

History
-------

Lithium ion batteries, first proposed in the 1960s, came into reality
once [Bell Labs](/wiki/Bell_Labs "wikilink") developed a workable graphite
anode[2] to provide an alternative to lithium metal, the [lithium
battery](lithium_battery "wikilink"). Following groundbreaking cathode
research by a team led by [John
Goodenough](/wiki/John_Goodenough "wikilink")[3] then at [Oxford
University](/wiki/Oxford_University "wikilink"), now at the [University of
Texas](/wiki/University_of_Texas "wikilink"), Austin, the first commercial
lithium ion battery was released by [Sony](/wiki/Sony "wikilink") in 1991.
Used in numerous commercial applications these batteries revolutionized
consumer electronics. One of the latest uses is in hybrid electric cars
and eventually electric vehicles. [Tesla](/wiki/Tesla_Motors "wikilink"),
[Reva](/wiki/REVA "wikilink") and [Kewet](Kewet "wikilink") are all releasing
new lithium ion battery electric car models in 2007.

Advantages and disadvantages
----------------------------

### Advantages

Lithium-ion batteries can be formed into a wide variety of shapes and
sizes so as to efficiently fill available space in the devices they
power.

Li-ion batteries are lighter than other equivalent [secondary
batteries](secondary_battery "wikilink")—often much lighter. The energy
is stored in these batteries through the movement of
[lithium](lithium "wikilink") [ions](ion "wikilink"). Lithium is the
third lightest element, giving a substantial saving in weight compared
to batteries using much heavier metals. However, the bulk of the
electrodes are effectively "housing" for the ions and add weight, and in
addition "dead weight" from the electrolyte, current collectors, casing,
electronics and conductivity additives reduce the charge per unit mass
to little more than that of other rechargeable batteries. The forte of
the Li-ion chemistry is the high [open circuit
voltage](open_circuit_voltage "wikilink") in comparison to aqueous
batteries (such as [lead acid](lead_acid "wikilink"), [nickel metal
hydride](/wiki/NiMH "wikilink") and [nickel cadmium](NiCd "wikilink")).

Li-ion batteries do not suffer from the [memory
effect](memory_effect "wikilink"). They also have a low self-discharge
rate of approximately 5% per month, compared with over 30% per month in
[nickel metal hydride](nickel_metal_hydride "wikilink") batteries and
10% per month in [nickel cadmium](nickel_cadmium "wikilink") batteries.

According to one manufacturer, Li-ion cells (and, accordingly, "dumb"
Li-ion batteries) do not have any self-discharge in the usual meaning of
this word.[4] What looks like a self-discharge in these batteries is a
permanent loss of capacity, described in more detail below. On the other
hand, "smart" Li-ion batteries do self-discharge, due to the small
constant drain of the built-in voltage monitoring circuit. This drain is
the most important source of self-discharge in these batteries.

### Disadvantages

A unique drawback of the Li-ion battery is that its life span is
dependent upon aging from time of manufacturing (shelf life) regardless
of whether it was charged, and not just on the number of
charge/discharge cycles. So an older battery will not last as long as a
new battery due solely to its age, unlike other batteries. This drawback
is not widely publicized.[5]

At a 100% charge level, a typical Li-ion [laptop](laptop "wikilink")
battery that is full most of the time at 25 degrees
[Celsius](/wiki/Celsius "wikilink") or 77 degrees
[Fahrenheit](/wiki/Fahrenheit "wikilink"), will irreversibly lose
approximately 20% capacity per year. However, a battery stored inside a
poorly ventilated laptop may be subject to a prolonged exposure to much
higher temperatures than 25 °C, which will significantly shorten its
life. The capacity loss begins from the time the battery was
manufactured, and occurs even when the battery is unused. Different
storage temperatures produce different loss results: 6% loss at 0 °C(32
°F), 20% at 25 °C(77 °F), and 35% at 40 °C(104 °F). When stored at 40%
charge level, these figures are reduced to 2%, 4%, 15% at 0, 25 and 40
degrees Celsius respectively.[6]

Li-ion batteries can even go into a state that is known as *Deep
Discharge*. At this point, the battery may take a very long time to
recharge. For example, a laptop battery that normally charges fully in 3
hours may take up to 42 hours to recharge. Or, the deep discharge state
may be so severe that the battery will never come back to life. Deep
discharging only takes place when products with rechargeable batteries
are left unused for extended periods of time (often 2 or more years) or
when they are recharged so often that they can no longer hold a charge.
This makes Li-ion batteries unsuitable for back-up applications compared
to lead-acid batteries, and even to Ni-MH batteries.

Because the maximum power that can be continuously drawn from the
battery depends on its capacity, in high-powered (relative to *C*, the
battery capacity in A·h) applications, like portable computers and video
cameras, rather than showing a gradual shortening of the running time of
the equipment, Li-ion batteries may often just abruptly fail.

Low-powered cyclical applications, like mobile phones, can get a much
longer lifetime out of a Li-ion battery.

A stand-alone Li-ion cell must never be discharged below a certain
voltage to avoid irreversible damage. Therefore all systems involving
Li-ion batteries are equipped with a circuit that shuts down the system
when the battery is discharged below the predefined threshold.[7] It
should thus be impossible to "deep discharge" the battery in a properly
designed system during normal use. This is also one of the reasons
Li-ion cells are rarely sold as such to consumers, but only as finished
batteries designed to fit a particular system.

When the voltage monitoring circuit is built inside the battery (a
so-called "smart" battery) rather than the equipment, it continuously
draws a small current from the battery even when the battery is not in
use; furthermore, the battery must not be stored fully discharged for
prolonged periods of time, to avoid damage due to deep discharge.

Li-ion batteries are not as durable as [nickel metal
hydride](nickel_metal_hydride_battery "wikilink") or
[nickel-cadmium](nickel-cadmium_battery "wikilink") designs and can be
extremely dangerous if mistreated. They are usually more expensive.

Li-ion chemistry is not safe as such, and a Li-ion cell requires several
mandatory safety devices to be built in before it can be considered safe
for use outside of a laboratory. These are: shut-down separator (for
overtemperature), tear-away tab (for internal pressure), vent (pressure
relief), and thermal interrupt (overcurrent/overcharging).[8] The
devices take away useful space inside the cells, and add an additional
layer of unreliability. Typically, their action is to permanently and
irreversibly disable the cell.

Despite these safety features, Li-ion batteries are the subject of
frequent recalls (see [\#Controversy](#Controversy "wikilink")).

The number of safety features can be compared with that of a [nickel
metal hydride](nickel_metal_hydride "wikilink") cell, which only has a
hydrogen/oxygen recombination device (preventing damage due to mild
overcharging) and a back-up pressure valve.

There is ongoing research to develop alternative Li-ion chemistries that
would be safe with fewer or no safety devices, such as [Valence
Technology](/wiki/Valence_Technology "wikilink").[9]

Specifications and design
-------------------------

-   Specific energy density: 150 to 200 [W·h](watt-hour "wikilink")/kg
    (540 to 720 [kJ](kilojoule "wikilink")/kg)
-   Volumetric energy density: 250 to 530 W·h/L (900 to 1900 J/cm3)
-   Specific power density: 300 to 1500 W/kg (@ 20 seconds[10] and 285
    W·h/L)

A typical chemical reaction of the Li-ion battery is as follows:

<center>

$\\mathrm{Li}\_{\\frac12} \\mathrm{Co} \\mathrm{O}\_2 + \\mathrm{Li}\_{\\frac12}\\mathrm{C}\_6 \\leftrightarrows \\mathrm{C}\_6 + \\mathrm{Li}\\mathrm{Co}\\mathrm{O}\_2$

</center>

 \[Note that in the above reaction the ½ subscripts relate to the
empirical formula; naturally, the atoms themselves are never split.\]
The actual ion involved in the above reaction is
*L**i*<sub>*x*</sub>*C**o**O*<sub>2</sub> . It is important to note that
lithium ions themselves are not being oxidized; rather, in a lithium ion
battery the lithium-ion complexes are used to transport the transition
metals to and from the cathode or anode, with the transition metal being
involved in the oxidation-reduction reaction on the surface of the anode
or cathode (depending on the battery terminal).

Lithium-ion batteries have a nominal [open-circuit
voltage](open-circuit_voltage "wikilink") of 3.6 [V](volt "wikilink")
and a typical charging voltage of 4.2 V. The charging procedure is done
at constant voltage with current limiting circuitry. This means charging
with constant current until a voltage of 4.2 V is reached by the cell
and continuing with a constant voltage applied until the current drops
close to zero. (Typically the charge is terminated at 7% of the initial
charge current.) In the past, lithium-ion batteries could not be
fast-charged and typically needed at least two hours to fully charge.
Current generation cells can be fully charged in 45 minutes or less;
some reach 90% in as little as 10 minutes.

Lithium ion internal design is as follows. The [anode](anode "wikilink")
is made from [carbon](carbon "wikilink"), the
[cathode](cathode "wikilink") is a metal [oxide](oxide "wikilink"), and
the [electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink") is a
[lithium](lithium "wikilink") [salt](salt "wikilink") in an
[organic](organic_compound "wikilink") [solvent](solvent "wikilink").

### Solid electrolyte interphase

A particularly important element for activating Li-ion
[batteries](batteries "wikilink") is the **solid electrolyte
interphase** (**SEI**). [Liquid](/wiki/Liquid "wikilink")
[electrolytes](electrolyte "wikilink") in Li-ion
[batteries](batteries "wikilink") consist of solid
[lithium](lithium "wikilink")-[salt](salt "wikilink")
[electrolytes](electrolyte "wikilink"), such as
[LiPF<sub>6</sub>](lithium_hexafluorophosphate "wikilink"),
[LiBF<sub>4</sub>](lithium_tetrafluoroborate "wikilink"), or
[LiClO<sub>4</sub>](lithium_perchlorate "wikilink"), and
[organic](organic_compound "wikilink") [solvents](solvents "wikilink"),
such as [ether](diethyl_ether "wikilink"). A liquid
[electrolyte](electrolyte "wikilink") conducts Li ions, which act as a
carrier between the [cathode](cathode "wikilink") and the
[anode](anode "wikilink") when a
[battery](battery_(electricity) "wikilink") passes an electric current
through an external circuit. However, solid electrolytes and organic
solvents are easily decomposed on [anodes](anodes "wikilink") during
charging, thus preventing battery activation. Nevertheless, when
appropriate [organic solvents](organic_solvent "wikilink") are used for
electrolytes, the electrolytes are decomposed and form a solid
electrolyte interface at first charge that is electrically insulating
and high Li-ion conducting. The interface prevents decomposition of the
electrolyte after the second charge. For example, [ethylene
carbonate](ethylene_carbonate "wikilink") is decomposed at a relatively
high voltage, 0.7 V vs. Li, and forms a dense and stable interface.

See [uranium trioxide](uranium_trioxide "wikilink") for some details of
how the cathode works. While uranium oxides are not used in commercially
made batteries, the way in which uranium oxides can reversibly insert
cations is the same as the way in which the cathode in many lithium-ion
cells work.

Guidelines for prolonging Li-ion battery life
---------------------------------------------

-   Unlike [Ni-Cd batteries](nickel-cadmium_battery "wikilink"),
    lithium-ion batteries should be charged early and often. However, if
    they are not used for a longer time, they should be brought to a
    charge level of around 40%. Lithium-ion batteries should never be
    "deep-cycled" like Ni-Cd batteries.[11]
-   Li-ion batteries should be kept cool. Ideally they are stored in a
    refrigerator. Aging will take its toll much faster at high
    temperatures. The high temperatures found in cars cause lithium-ion
    batteries to degrade rapidly.
-   Lithium-ion batteries should never be depleted to empty (0%).
-   According to one book,[12] lithium ion batteries should not be
    frozen (should not be stored under -40 °C), because most lithium-ion
    battery electrolytes freeze at approximately −40 °C (this is much
    colder than the lowest temperature reached by household freezers,
    however).
-   Li-ion batteries should be bought only when needed, because the
    aging process begins as soon as the battery is manufactured.[13]
-   When using a notebook computer running from fixed line power over
    extended periods, the battery can be removed and stored in a cool
    place so that it is not affected by the heat produced by the
    computer.[14]

### Storage temperature and charge

Storing a Li-ion battery at the correct temperature and charge makes all
the difference in maintaining its storage capacity. The following table
shows the amount of *permanent* capacity loss that will occur after
storage at a given charge level and temperature.

| Storage Temperature                 | 40% Charge                | 100% Charge                     |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 0 °C (32 °F)                        | **2%** loss after 1 year  | **6%** loss after 1 year        |
| 25 °C (77 °F)                       | **4%** loss after 1 year  | **20%** loss after 1 year       |
| 40 °C (104 °F)                      | **15%** loss after 1 year | **35%** loss after 1 year       |
| 60 °C (140 °F)                      | **25%** loss after 1 year | **40%** loss after **3 months** |
| ''Source: BatteryUniversity.com[15] |                           |                                 |

It is significantly beneficial to avoid storing a lithium-ion battery at
full charge. A Li-ion battery stored at 40% charge will last many times
longer than one stored at 100% charge, particularly at higher
temperatures.[16]

If a Li-ion battery is stored with too low a charge, there is a risk of
allowing the charge to drop below the battery's low-voltage threshold,
resulting in an unrecoverably dead battery. Once the charge has dropped
to this level, recharging it can be dangerous. An internal safety
circuit will therefore open to prevent charging, and the battery will be
for all practical purposes dead.[17]

In circumstances where a second Li-ion battery is available for a given
device, it is recommended that the unused battery be discharged to 40%
and placed in the refrigerator to prolong its shelf life. *Batteries
should be allowed to completely warm to room temperature over up to 24
hours before any discharge or charge*.

Controversy
-----------

Lithium-ion batteries can easily rupture, ignite, or explode when
exposed to high temperatures,[18] or direct sunlight. They should not be
stored in a car during hot weather. Short-circuiting a Li-ion battery
can cause it to ignite or explode. Never open a Li-ion battery's casing.
Li-ion batteries contain safety devices that protect the cells inside
from abuse. If damaged, these can also cause the battery to ignite or
explode.

Contaminants inside the cells can defeat these safety devices. The
mid-2006 recall of 10 million Sony batteries used in
[Dell](Dell "wikilink"), [Sony](/wiki/Sony "wikilink"),
[Apple](/wiki/Apple_Computer "wikilink"),
[Lenovo](/wiki/Lenovo "wikilink")/[IBM](IBM "wikilink"),
[Panasonic](/wiki/Panasonic "wikilink"), [Toshiba](Toshiba "wikilink"),
[Hitachi](/wiki/Hitachi "wikilink"), [Fujitsu](Fujitsu "wikilink") and
[Sharp](/wiki/Sharp "wikilink") laptops was stated to be as a consequence of
internal contamination with metal particles. Under some circumstances,
these can pierce the separator, rapidly converting all of the energy in
the cell to heat.[19] However, there are problems that go beyond this
and this explanation is not complete.

The mid-2006 Sony laptop battery recall isn't the first of its kind, but
it is the largest. During the past decade there have been numerous
recalls of lithium-ion batteries in cellular phones and laptops owing to
overheating problems. Last December, Dell pulled about 22,000 batteries
from the U.S. market. In 2004, Kyocera Wireless recalled about 1 million
batteries used in phones.[20] In March 2007, Lenovo recalled another
205,000 9-cell lithium ion batteries because of an explosion risk.

"It is possible to replace the lithium cobalt oxide cathode material in
li-ion batteries with lithiated metal phosphate cathodes that don’t
explode and even have a longer shelf life. But for the moment these
safer li-ion batteries seem mainly destined for electric cars and other
large-capacity applications, where the safety issues are more
critical... The fact is that lithiated metal phosphate batteries hold
only about 75 percent as much power..."[21]

New technology
--------------

In February 2005, [Altairnano](/wiki/Altairnano "wikilink"),[22] a small firm
based in [Reno, Nevada](/wiki/Reno,_Nevada "wikilink"), announced a nano-sized
titanate electrode material for lithium-ion batteries. Its prototype
battery has three times the power of existing batteries and can be fully
charged in six minutes. The company also says the battery can handle
approximately 20,000 recharging cycles, so durability and battery life
are much longer, estimated to be around 20 years or four times longer
than regular lithium-ion batteries. The batteries can operate from -50
°C to over 75 °C and will not explode or result in thermal runaway even
under severe conditions because they do not contain
graphite-coated-metal anode electrode material.[23] The batteries are
currently being tested in a new production car made by [Phoenix
Motorcars](/wiki/Phoenix_Motorcars "wikilink") which was on display at the
2006 SEMA motorshow.

In March of 2005, Toshiba announced another fast charging lithium-ion
battery, based on new nano-material technology, that provides even
faster charge times, greater capacity, and a longer life cycle. The
battery may be used in commercial products in 2006 or early 2007,
primarily in the industrial and automotive sectors.[24]

In November 2005, [A123Systems](/wiki/A123Systems "wikilink") announced[25] a
new higher power, faster recharging Li-Ion battery system[26][27] based
on research licensed from MIT. Their first cell is in production
(1Q/2006)[28] and being used in [DeWalt](/wiki/DeWalt "wikilink") power tools
and [Hybrids Plus](/wiki/Hybrids_Plus "wikilink") Prius
[PHEV](/wiki/PHEV "wikilink") conversions (although the conversion costs more
than the original price of the car, mostly due to the price of the
batteries).

All these formulations involve new electrodes. By increasing the
effective electrode area — thus decreasing the internal resistance of
the battery — the current can be increased during both use and charging.
This is similar to developments in
[ultracapacitors](ultracapacitor "wikilink"). Therefore, the battery is
capable of delivering more power (watts); however, the battery's
capacity (ampere-hours) is increased only slightly.

In April 2006, a group of scientists at [MIT](/wiki/MIT "wikilink") announced
that they had figured out a way to use viruses to form nano-sized wires
that can be used to build ultrathin lithium-ion batteries with three
times the normal energy density.[29]

As of June 2006, researchers in France have created nanostructured
battery electrodes with several times the energy capacity, by weight and
volume, of conventional electrodes.[30]
