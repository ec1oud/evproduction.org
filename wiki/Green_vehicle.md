A **green vehicle** is a [vehicle](vehicle "wikilink") that is
considered to be "[environmentally
friendly](environmentalism "wikilink")". This is accomplished by having
a low [dust to dust energy cost](dust_to_dust_energy_cost "wikilink").
Part of the total energy cost can be cut by choosing smaller, lighter
vehicles that use less energy to produce (Production phase).

Energy efficiency
-----------------

During the life of the car (operational phase), large reductions in
energy costs can be made through several measures:

-   The most significant is by using [alternative
    propulsion](alternative_propulsion "wikilink"):
    -   An efficient engine that reduces the vehicle's consumption of
        [petroleum](petroleum "wikilink") (i.e. [petroleum electric
        hybrid vehicle](petroleum_electric_hybrid_vehicle "wikilink")),
        or, preferably, that uses [renewable
        energy](renewable_energy "wikilink") sources throughout its
        working life (i.e. [battery electric
        vehicle](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") or [plug-in
        hybrid](plug-in_hybrid "wikilink")).
    -   Using [biofuels](biofuel "wikilink") instead of petroleum fuels.
-   Proper maintenance of a vehicle such as engine tune-ups, oil
    changes, and maintaining proper tire pressure can also help.
-   Removing unnecessary items from a vehicle reduces weight and
    improves fuel economy as well.

Types
-----

Examples of vehicles with reduced petroleum consumption include
[electric cars](electric_car "wikilink"), [hybrid
cars](hybrid_car "wikilink") and [hydrogen
cars](hydrogen_car "wikilink"). [Solar car](/wiki/Solar_car "wikilink") races
are held on a regular basis in order to promote green vehicles and other
"[green technology](green_technology "wikilink")". These sleek
driver-only vehicles can travel long distances at highway speeds using
only the electricity generated instantaneously from the sun.

A conventional vehicle can become a greener vehicle of a sort by mixing
in renewable fuels. Typical [gasoline](gasoline "wikilink") cars can
handle up to 15% [ethanol](alcohol_fuel "wikilink"). There are some
places that have built cars that run strictly on ethanol, but another
option is a [flexible-fuel vehicle](flexible-fuel_vehicle "wikilink"),
which allows a varying mixture (often up to 85%, sometimes up to
100%[1]. [Diesel](diesel_fuel "wikilink")-powered vehicles can often
transition completely to [biodiesel](biodiesel "wikilink"), though the
fuel is a very strong [solvent](solvent "wikilink"), which can
occasionally damage [rubber](rubber "wikilink") seals in vehicles built
before 1994. More commonly, however, biodiesel causes problems simply
because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine, clogging
[filters](filter_(chemistry) "wikilink"), unless care is taken when
switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel.

European Union
--------------

The [European Union](/wiki/European_Union "wikilink") is promoting the
marketing of greener cars via a combination of binding and non-binding
measures.[2]

Environmental Protection Agency
-------------------------------

The US [Environmental Protection
Agency](/wiki/Environmental_Protection_Agency "wikilink") is promoting the
marketing of greener cars via the [SmartWay](/wiki/SmartWay "wikilink")
program. The SmartWay and SmartWay Elite designation mean that a vehicle
is a better environmental performer relative to other vehicles. This US
EPA designation is arrived at by taking into account a vehicle's Air
Pollution Score and Greenhouse Gas Score. Higher Air Pollution Scores
indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of pollutants that cause smog
relative to other vehicles. Higher Greenhouse Gas Scores indicate
vehicles that emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide and have improved
fuel economy relative to other vehicles.

To earn the SmartWay designation, a vehicle must earn at least a 6 on
the Air Pollution Score and at least a 6 on the Greenhouse Gas Score,
but have a combined score of at least 13. SmartWay Elite is given to
those vehicles that score 9 or better on both the Greenhouse Gas and Air
Pollution Scores.

Green Vehicle Benefits
----------------------

### Environmental

Vehicle emissions contribute to the increasing concentration of gases
that are leading to [climate change](climate_change "wikilink"). In
order of significance, the principal [greenhouse
gases](greenhouse_gases "wikilink") associated with road transport are
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Road
transport is the third largest source of UK greenhouse gases and
accounts for over 20% of total emissions.[3] Of the total greenhouse gas
emissions from transport, over 85% are due to CO2 emissions from road
vehicles. The transport sector is the fastest growing source of
greenhouse gases.

Road transport also remains the main source of many local emissions
including [benzene](benzene "wikilink"), 1,3-butadiene, [carbon
monoxide](carbon_monoxide "wikilink") (CO), [nitrogen
oxides](nitrogen_oxides "wikilink") (NOx) and
[particulates](particulates "wikilink") (PMs). Within urban areas, the
percentage of contributions due to road transport is particularly high -
in London road transport contributes almost 80% of particulate
emissions.

### Health

Vehicle pollutants have been linked to human ill health including the
incidence of respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer. In
1998, a report entitled "The Medical Effects of Air Pollutants"[4]
estimated that up to 24,000 people die prematurely each year in the UK
as a direct result of air pollution. According to the [World Health
Organisation](/wiki/World_Health_Organisation "wikilink"), up to 13,000 deaths
per year among children (aged 0-4 years) across Europe are directly
attributable to outdoor pollution. The organisation estimates that if
pollution levels were returned to within EU limits, more than 5,000 of
these lives could be saved each year.

Currently there is no EU law which limits the amount of carbon dioxide
produced by cars. However the European Commission reached a voluntary
agreement with the [European Automobile Manufacturers
Association](/wiki/European_Automobile_Manufacturers_Association "wikilink")
to reduce the average CO2 emissions to 140g/km by 2008 for all new cars
sold in the EU with a possible second target of 120g/km by 2012.

### Monetary

Many fleet operators of hybrid vehicles have reduced brake maintenance
costs, through less use of brake parts due to regenerative braking. The
labour costs saved from this maintenance is also significant. As much as
65% of brake related costs have been saved, according to a report by the
[Toronto Transit Commission](/wiki/Toronto_Transit_Commission "wikilink").

Hybrid taxi fleet operators in New York have also reported that reduced
fuel consumption saves them thousands of dollars per year, as well as
reduced maintenance costs.

Controversy
-----------

A two-year study by CNW Marketing Research[5] suggests that the extra
energy cost of manufacture, shipping, disposal, and the short lives of
some of these types of vehicle (particularly gas-electric hybrids)
outweighs any energy savings made by their using less petroleum during
their useful lifespan. These claims are **under dispute**. The latest
version of the report incorporates more data through 2006 and revises
much of the conclusions. More information on this topic is available at
[Petroleum-electric hybrid
vehicles](/wiki/Petroleum_electric_hybrid_vehicle "wikilink"), particularly
the section on [CNW Marketing
Reports](/wiki/Petroleum_electric_hybrid_vehicle#CNW_Marketing_Reports "wikilink").

The [battery electric vehicles](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") are
sustainable vehicles.
