*This page is about vehicle drive electric motors.*

An **electric motor** converts [electrical
energy](electrical_energy "wikilink") into [mechanical
energy](mechanical_energy "wikilink"). The reverse task, that of
converting mechanical energy into electrical energy, is accomplished by
a [generator](/wiki/Electrical_generator "wikilink") or dynamo. [Traction
motors](/wiki/Traction_motor "wikilink") used on
[locomotives](locomotive "wikilink") often perform both tasks if the
locomotive is equipped with [dynamic brakes](dynamic_brake "wikilink").
Electric motors are found in household appliances such as fans, fridges,
washing machines, pool pumps and fan-forced ovens.

Most electric motors work by [electromagnetism](magnetism "wikilink"),
but motors based on other electromechanical phenomena, such as
[electrostatic forces](electrostatic_motor "wikilink") and the
[piezoelectric effect](piezoelectric_effect "wikilink"), also exist. The
fundamental principle upon which electromagnetic motors are based is
that there is a [mechanical force](/wiki/Lorenz_force "wikilink") on any
current-carrying wire contained within a magnetic field. The force is
described by the [Lorentz force law](magnetic_field "wikilink") and is
perpendicular to both the wire and the magnetic field. Most magnetic
motors are rotary, but [linear motors](linear_motor "wikilink") also
exist. In a rotary motor, the rotating part (usually on the inside) is
called the [rotor](/wiki/Rotor_(electric) "wikilink"), and the stationary part
is called the [stator](stator "wikilink"). The rotor rotates because the
wires and magnetic field are arranged so that a
[torque](torque "wikilink") is developed about the rotor's axis. The
motor contains [electromagnets](electromagnet "wikilink") that are wound
on a frame. Though this frame is often called the
[armature](armature_(electrical_engineering) "wikilink"), that term is
often erroneously applied. Correctly, the armature is that part of the
motor across which the input [voltage](voltage "wikilink") is supplied.
Depending upon the design of the machine, either the rotor or the stator
can serve as the armature.

History and Development
-----------------------

The principle of conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy
by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the British scientist
[Michael Faraday](/wiki/Michael_Faraday "wikilink") in [1821](1821 "wikilink")
and consisted of a free-hanging wire dipping into a pool of
[mercury](mercury_(element) "wikilink"). A permanent
[magnet](magnet "wikilink") was placed in the middle of the pool of
mercury. When a [current](/wiki/Current_(electricity) "wikilink") was passed
through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the
current gave rise to a circular magnetic field around the wire. This
motor is often demonstrated in school physics classes, but
[brine](brine "wikilink") (salt water) is sometimes used in place of the
toxic mercury. This is the simplest form of a class of electric motors
called [homopolar motors](homopolar_motor "wikilink"). A later
refinement is the [Barlow's Wheel](/wiki/Barlow's_Wheel "wikilink"). These
were demonstration devices, unsuited to practical applications due to
limited power.

The first [commutator](/wiki/Commutator_(electric) "wikilink")-type
direct-current electric motor capable of a practical application was
invented by the British scientist [William
Sturgeon](/wiki/William_Sturgeon "wikilink"). He was self-educated in the
natural sciences and the science of electricity, and he spent much time
experimenting with electricity and lecturing on the topic. In 1825, he
delivered a lecture to his class at the [Royal Military
College](/wiki/Royal_Military_College "wikilink") in which he demonstrated a
7-ounce electromagnet capable of carrying 9 pounds (4 kilograms) of iron
when a current from a single cell was sent through the electromagnet
coils. In 1832, Sturgeon invented an electric motor which had a
[commutator](/wiki/Commutator_(electric) "wikilink"), the critical part of a
modern DC motor. His other achievements include the improvement of the
electrochemical battery, contributions to the theory of thermo
electricity, and the discovery that the atmosphere in serene weather is
positively charged with respect to the earth.

A commutator-type direct-current electric motor built with the intention
of commercial use was invented by the American [Thomas
Davenport](/wiki/Thomas_Davenport "wikilink") and patented in 1837. Although
several motors were built and operated equipment such as a printing
press, due to the high cost of [primary battery
power](battery_(electricity) "wikilink"), the motors were unsuccessful
commercially and Davenport went bankrupt.

Although several inventors followed
[Sturgeon](/wiki/William_Sturgeon "wikilink") in the development of DC motors,
in the days before electric power distribution these motors had to
depend on expensive [primary battery
power](battery_(electricity) "wikilink"). This meant that these motors
had no practical commercial market.

The modern DC motor was invented by accident in 1873, when [Zénobe
Gramme](/wiki/Zénobe_Gramme "wikilink") connected a spinning
[dynamo](dynamo "wikilink") to a second similar unit, driving it as a
motor. The [Gramme machine](/wiki/Gramme_machine "wikilink") was the first
industrially useful electric motor; earlier inventions were used as toys
or laboratory curiosities.

DC motors

</figure>Image:Electric\_motor\_cycle\_1.png\|A simple DC electric
motor. When the coil is powered, a magnetic field is generated around
the armature. The left side of the armature is pushed away from the left
magnet and drawn toward the right, causing rotation.
Image:Electric\_motor\_cycle\_2.png\|The armature continues to rotate.
Image:Electric\_motor\_cycle\_3.png\|When the armature becomes
horizontally aligned, the commutator reverses the direction of current
through the coil, reversing the magnetic field. The process then
repeats.

If the shaft of a DC motor is turned by an external force, the motor
will act like a generator and produce an [Electromotive
force](/wiki/Electromotive_force "wikilink") (EMF). During normal operation,
the spinning of the motor produces a voltage, known as the counter-EMF
(CEMF) or back EMF, because it opposes the applied voltage on the motor.
This is the same EMF that is produced when the motor is used as a
generator (for example when an electrical load (resistance) is placed
across the terminals of the motor and the motor shaft is driven with an
external torque). Therefore, the voltage drop across a motor consists of
the voltage drop, due to this CEMF, and the parasitic voltage drop
resulting from the internal resistance of the armature's windings. The
current through a motor is given by the following equation:

<big>*I* = (*V*<sub>*a**p**p**l**i**e**d*</sub> − *V*<sub>*c**e**m**f*</sub>)/*R*<sub>*a**r**m**a**t**u**r**e*</sub></big>

The mechanical power produced by the motor is given by:

<big>*P* = *I* \* (*V*<sub>*c**e**m**f*</sub>)</big>

Mechanism of the DC motors:

When current passes through the coil wound around a soft iron core the
side of the positive pole is acted upon by an upwards force, while the
other side is acted upon by a downward force. According to [Fleming's
left hand rule](/wiki/Fleming's_left_hand_rule "wikilink"), the forces cause a
turning effect on the coil making it rotate; to make the motor rotate in
a constant direction "direct current" commutators make the current
reverse in direction every half a cycle thus causing the motor to rotate
in the same direction.The problem facing the motor is when the plane of
the coil is parallel to the magnetic field;i.e. the turning effect is
ZERO-when coil is at 90 degree from its original position-yet, the coil
continues to rotate by inertia.

Since the CEMF is proportional to motor speed, when an electric motor is
first started or is completely stalled, there is zero CEMF. Therefore
the current through the armature is much higher. This high current will
produce a strong magnetic field which will start the motor spinning. As
the motor spins, the CEMF increases until it is equal to the applied
voltage, minus the parasitic voltage drop. At this point, there will be
a smaller current flowing through the motor. Basically, the following
three equations can be used to find the speed, current, and back EMF of
a motor under a load:

<big>*L**o**a**d* = *V*<sub>*c**e**m**f*</sub> \* *I*</big>

<big>*V*<sub>*a**p**p**l**i**e**d*</sub> = *I* \* *R*<sub>*a**r**m**a**t**u**r**e*</sub> + *V*<sub>*c**e**m**f*</sub></big>

<big>*V*<sub>*c**e**m**f*</sub> = *s**p**e**e**d* \* *F**l**u**x*<sub>*a**r**m**a**t**u**r**e*</sub></big>

Speed control
-------------

Generally, the rotational speed of a DC motor is proportional to the
voltage applied to it, and the [torque](torque "wikilink") is
proportional to the current. Speed control can be achieved by variable
battery tappings, variable supply voltage, resistors or electronic
controls. The direction of a wound field DC motor can be changed by
reversing either the field or armature connections but not both. This is
commonly done with a special set of [contactors](relay "wikilink")
(direction contactors).

The effective voltage can be varied by inserting a series resistor or by
an electronically controlled switching device made of
[thyristors](thyristor "wikilink"),
[transistors](transistor "wikilink"), or, formerly, [mercury arc
rectifiers](mercury_arc_valve "wikilink"). In a circuit known as a
[chopper](/wiki/Chopper_(electronics) "wikilink"), the average voltage applied
to the motor is varied by switching the supply voltage very rapidly. As
the "on" to "off" ratio is varied to alter the average applied voltage,
the speed of the motor varies. The percentage "on" time multiplied by
the supply voltage gives the average voltage applied to the motor.
Therefore, with a 100 V supply and a 25% "on" time, the average voltage
at the motor will be 25 V. During the "off" time, the armature's
inductance causes the current to continue flowing through a diode called
a "flywheel diode", in parallel with the motor. At this point in the
cycle, the supply current will be zero, and therefore the average motor
current will always be higher than the supply current unless the
percentage "on" time is 100%. At 100% "on" time, the supply and motor
current are equal. The rapid switching wastes less energy than series
resistors. This method is also called pulse width modulation, or PWM,
and is often controlled by a microprocessor. An output
[filter](/wiki/Electronic_filter "wikilink") is sometimes installed to smooth
the average voltage applied to the motor and reduce motor noise.

Since the series-wound DC motor develops its highest torque at low
speed, it is often used in [traction](/wiki/Traction_motor "wikilink")
applications such as electric [locomotives](locomotive "wikilink"), and
[trams](tram "wikilink"). Another application is starter motors for
petrol and small diesel engines. Series motors must never be used in
applications where the drive can fail (such as belt drives). As the
motor accelerates, the armature (and hence field) current reduces. The
reduction in field causes the motor to speed up (see 'weak field' in the
last section) until it destroys itself. This can also be a problem with
railway motors in the event of a loss of adhesion since, unless quickly
brought under control, the motors can reach speeds far higher than they
would do under normal circumstances. This can not only cause problems
for the motors themselves and the gears, but due to the differential
speed between the rails and the wheels it can also cause serious damage
to the rails and wheel treads as they heat and cool rapidly. Field
weakening is used in some electronic controls to increase the top speed
of an electric vehicle. The simplest form uses a contactor and field
weakening resistor, the electronic control monitors the motor current
and switches the field weakening resistor into circuit when the motor
current reduces below a preset value (this will be when the motor is at
its full design speed). Once the resistor is in circuit, the motor will
increase speed above its normal speed at its rated voltage. When motor
current increases, the control will disconnect the resistor and low
speed torque is made available.

One interesting method of speed control of a DC motor is the
[Ward-Leonard
control](/wiki/Harry_Ward_Leonard#The_Ward_Leonard_motor_control_system "wikilink").
It is a method of controlling a DC motor (usually a shunt or compound
wound) and was developed as a method of providing a speed-controlled
motor from an AC supply, though it is not without its advantages in DC
schemes. The AC supply is used to drive an AC motor, usually an
induction motor that drives a DC generator or
[dynamo](dynamo "wikilink"). The DC output from the armature is directly
connected to the armature of the DC motor (sometimes but not always of
identical construction). The shunt field windings of both DC machines
are independently excited through variable resistors. Extremely good
speed control from standstill to full speed, and consistent torque, can
be obtained by varying the generator and/or motor field current. This
method of control was the *de facto* method from its development until
it was superseded by solid state [thyristor](thyristor "wikilink")
systems. It found service in almost any environment where good speed
control was required, from passenger lifts through to large mine pit
head winding gear and even industrial process machinery and electric
cranes. Its principal disadvantage was that three machines were required
to implement a scheme (five in very large installations, as the DC
machines were often duplicated and controlled by a tandem variable
resistor). In many applications, the motor-generator set was often left
permanently running, to avoid the delays that would otherwise be caused
by starting it up as required. Although electronic (thyristor)
controllers have replaced most small to medium Ward Leonard systems,
some very large ones (thousands of horsepower) remain in service. The
field currents are much lower than the armature currents, allowing a
moderate sized thryistor unit to control a much larger motor than it
could control directly. For example, in one installation, a 300 amp
thyristor unit controls the field of the generator. The generator output
current is in excess of 15,000 amps, which would be prohibitively
expensive (and inefficient) to control directly with thyristors.

Universal motors
----------------

A variant of the wound field **DC motor** is the *universal motor*. The
name derives from the fact that it may use AC or DC supply current,
although in practice they are nearly always used with AC supplies. The
principle is that in a wound field DC motor the current in both the
field and the armature (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will
alternate (reverse polarity) at the same time, and hence the mechanical
force generated is always in the same direction. In practice, the motor
must be specially designed to cope with the AC current
([impedance](/wiki/Electrical_impedance "wikilink") must be taken into
account, as must the pulsating force), and the resultant motor is
generally less efficient than an equivalent pure **DC** motor. Operating
at normal power line frequencies, the maximum output of universal motors
is limited and motors exceeding one kilowatt are rare. But universal
motors also form the basis of the traditional railway [traction
motor](traction_motor "wikilink"). In this application, to keep their
electrical efficiency high, they were operated from very low frequency
AC supplies, with 25 Hz and 16 <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> hertz operation
being common. Because they are universal motors, locomotives using this
design were also commonly capable of operating from a [third
rail](third_rail "wikilink") powered by [DC](/wiki/Direct_current "wikilink").

The advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on
motors which have the typical characteristics of DC motors, specifically
high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are
used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems
caused by the [commutator](/wiki/Commutator_(electric) "wikilink"). As a
result such motors are usually used in AC devices such as food mixers
and power tools which are used only intermittently. Continuous speed
control of a universal motor running on AC is very easily accomplished
using a [thyristor](thyristor "wikilink") circuit, while stepped speed
control can be accomplished using multiple taps on the field coil.
Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field
coil with several taps and a [diode](diode "wikilink") that can be
inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave
rectified AC).

Universal motors can rotate at relatively high revolution per minute
(rpm). This makes them useful for appliances such as
[blenders](blender_(device) "wikilink"), [vacuum
cleaners](vacuum_cleaner "wikilink"), and [hair
dryers](hair_dryer "wikilink") where high-speed operation is desired.
Many vacuum cleaner and [weed trimmer](/wiki/String_trimmer "wikilink") motors
exceed 10,000 rpm, [Dremel](/wiki/Dremel "wikilink") and other similar
miniature grinders will often exceed 30,000 rpm. Motor damage may occur
due to overspeed (rpm in excess of design specifications) if the unit is
operated with no significant load. On larger motors, sudden loss of load
is to be avoided, and the possibility of such an occurrence is
incorporated into the motor's protection and control schemes.

With the very low cost of [semiconductor](semiconductor "wikilink")
[rectifiers](rectifier "wikilink"), some applications that would have
previously used a universal motor now use a pure DC motor, sometimes
with a permanent magnet field.

AC Motors
---------

In 1882, [Nikola Tesla](/wiki/Nikola_Tesla "wikilink") identified the
[rotating magnetic field](alternator "wikilink") principle, and
pioneered the use of a rotary field of force to operate machines. He
exploited the principle to design a unique two-phase induction motor in
1883. In 1885, [Galileo Ferraris](/wiki/Galileo_Ferraris "wikilink")
independently researched the concept. In 1888, Ferraris published his
research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin.

Introduction of Tesla's motor from 1888 onwards initiated what is
sometimes referred to as the *[Second Industrial
Revolution](/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution "wikilink")*, making possible
the efficient generation and long distance distribution of electrical
energy using the alternating current transmission system, also of
Tesla's invention (1888).[1] Before the invention of the rotating
magnetic field, motors operated by continually passing a conductor
through a stationary magnetic field (as in [homopolar
motors](homopolar_motor "wikilink")).

Tesla had suggested that the
[commutators](/wiki/Commutator_(electric) "wikilink") from a machine could be
removed and the device could operate on a rotary field of force.
Professor Poeschel, his teacher, stated that would be akin to building a
[perpetual motion machine](perpetual_motion_machine "wikilink").[2]
Tesla would later attain , *Electric Motor* (December 1889), which
resembles the motor seen in many of Tesla's photos. This classic
alternating current electro-magnetic motor was an **induction motor**.

[Michail Osipovich
Dolivo-Dobrovolsky](/wiki/Michail_Osipovich_Dolivo-Dobrovolsky "wikilink")
later invented a three-phase "cage-rotor" in 1890. This type of motor is
now used for the vast majority of commercial applications.

### Components and types

A typical AC motor consists of two parts:

1.  An outside stationary stator having coils supplied with AC current
    to produce a rotating magnetic field, and;
2.  An inside rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque
    by the rotating field.

There are two fundamental types of AC motor, depending on the type of
rotor used:

-   The synchronous motor, which rotates exactly at the supply frequency
    or a submultiple of the supply frequency, and;
-   The induction motor, which turns slightly slower, and typically
    (though not necessarily always) takes the form of the [squirrel
    cage](/wiki/Squirrel_cage_rotor "wikilink") motor.

### Three-phase AC induction motors

</figure>Where a polyphase electrical supply is available, the
[three-phase](three-phase "wikilink") (or
[polyphase](polyphase_system "wikilink")) AC induction motor is commonly
used, especially for higher-powered motors. The phase differences
between the three phases of the polyphase electrical supply create a
rotating electromagnetic field in the motor.

Through [electromagnetic
induction](electromagnetic_induction "wikilink"), the [rotating magnetic
field](rotating_magnetic_field "wikilink") induces a current in the
conductors in the rotor, which in turn sets up a counterbalancing
magnetic field that causes the rotor to turn in the direction the field
is rotating. The rotor must always rotate slower than the rotating
magnetic field produced by the polyphase electrical supply; otherwise,
no counterbalancing field will be produced in the rotor.

Induction motors are the workhorses of industry and motors up to about
500 kW (670 [horsepower](horsepower "wikilink")) in output are produced
in highly standardized frame sizes, making them nearly completely
interchangeable between manufacturers (although European and North
American standard dimensions are different). Very large induction motors
are capable of tens of thousands of kW in output, for pipeline
compressors, wind-tunnel drives and overland conveyor systems.

There are two types of rotors used in induction motors.

**Squirrel Cage rotors:** Most common AC motors use the [squirrel cage
rotor](squirrel_cage_rotor "wikilink"), which will be found in virtually
all domestic and light industrial alternating current motors. The
squirrel cage takes its name from its shape - a ring at either end of
the rotor, with bars connecting the rings running the length of the
rotor. It is typically cast aluminum or copper poured between the iron
laminates of the rotor, and usually only the end rings will be visible.
The vast majority of the rotor currents will flow through the bars
rather than the higher-resistance and usually varnished laminates. Very
low voltages at very high currents are typical in the bars and end
rings; high efficiency motors will often use cast copper in order to
reduce the resistance in the rotor.

In operation, the squirrel cage motor may be viewed as a
[transformer](transformer "wikilink") with a rotating secondary - when
the rotor is not rotating in sync with the magnetic field, large rotor
currents are induced; the large rotor currents magnetize the rotor and
interact with the stator's magnetic fields to bring the rotor into
synchronization with the stator's field. An unloaded squirrel cage motor
at synchronous speed will consume electrical power only to maintain
rotor speed against friction and resistance losses; as the mechanical
load increases, so will the electrical load - the electrical load is
inherently related to the mechanical load. This is similar to a
transformer, where the primary's electrical load is related to the
secondary's electrical load.

This is why, as an example, a squirrel cage blower motor may cause the
lights in a home to dim as it starts, but doesn't dim the lights when
its fanbelt (and therefore mechanical load) is removed. Furthermore, a
stalled squirrel cage motor (overloaded or with a jammed shaft) will
consume current limited only by circuit resistance as it attempts to
start. Unless something else limits the current (or cuts it off
completely) overheating and destruction of the winding insulation is the
likely outcome.

Virtually every [washing machine](washing_machine "wikilink"),
[dishwasher](dishwasher "wikilink"), standalone
[fan](fan_(implement) "wikilink"), [record
player](record_player "wikilink"), etc. uses some variant of a squirrel
cage motor.

**Wound Rotor:** An alternate design, called the wound rotor, is used
when variable speed is required. In this case, the rotor has the same
number of poles as the stator and the windings are made of wire,
connected to slip rings on the shaft. Carbon brushes connect the slip
rings to an external controller such as a variable resistor that allows
changing the motor's slip rate. In certain high-power variable speed
wound-rotor drives, the slip-frequency energy is captured, rectified and
returned to the power supply through an inverter.

Compared to squirrel cage rotors, wound rotor motors are expensive and
require maintenance of the slip rings and brushes, but they were the
standard form for variable speed control before the advent of compact
power electronic devices. Transistorized inverters with
[variable-frequency drive](variable-frequency_drive "wikilink") can now
be used for speed control, and wound rotor motors are becoming less
common. (Transistorized inverter drives also allow the more-efficient
three-phase motors to be used when only single-phase mains current is
available, but this is never used in household appliances, because it
can cause electrical interference and because of high power
requirements.)

Several methods of starting a polyphase motor are used. Where the large
inrush current and high starting torque can be permitted, the motor can
be started across the line, by applying full line voltage to the
terminals (Direct-on-line, DOL). Where it is necessary to limit the
starting inrush current (where the motor is large compared with the
short-circuit capacity of the supply), reduced voltage starting using
either series inductors, an
[autotransformer](autotransformer "wikilink"),
[thyristors](thyristor "wikilink"), or other devices are used. A
technique sometimes used is (Star-Delta, YΔ) starting, where the motor
coils are initially connected in wye for acceleration of the load, then
switched to delta when the load is up to speed. This technique is more
common in Europe than in North America. Transistorized drives can
directly vary the applied voltage as required by the starting
characteristics of the motor and load.

This type of motor is becoming more common in traction applications such
as locomotives, where it is known as the asynchronous [traction
motor](traction_motor "wikilink").

The speed of the AC motor is determined primarily by the frequency of
the AC supply and the number of poles in the stator winding, according
to the relation:

*N*<sub>*s*</sub> = 120*F*/*p*

where

  
*N<sub>s</sub>* = Synchronous speed, in revolutions per minute

*F* = AC power frequency

*p* = Number of poles per phase winding

Actual RPM for an induction motor will be less than this calculated
synchronous speed by an amount known as *slip*, that increases with the
torque produced. With no load, the speed will be very close to
synchronous. When loaded, standard motors have between 2-3% slip,
special motors may have up to 7% slip, and a class of motors known as
*torque motors* are rated to operate at 100% slip (0 RPM/full stall).

The slip of the AC motor is calculated by:

*S* = (*N*<sub>*s*</sub> − *N**r*)/*N*<sub>*s*</sub>

*p**e**r**c**e**n**t**a**g**e**s**l**i**p* = (*N*<sub>*s*</sub> − *N**r*)/*N*<sub>*s*</sub> \* 100

where

  
*N<sub>r</sub>* = Rotational speed, in revolutions per minute.

*S* = Normalised Slip, 0 to 1.

As an example, a typical four-pole motor running on 60 Hz might have a
nameplate rating of 1725 RPM at full load, while its calculated speed is
1800 RPM.

The speed in this type of motor has traditionally been altered by having
additional sets of coils or poles in the motor that can be switched on
and off to change the speed of magnetic field rotation. However,
developments in [power electronics](power_electronics "wikilink") mean
that the frequency of the power supply can also now be varied to provide
a smoother control of the motor speed.

### Three-phase AC synchronous motors

If connections to the rotor coils of a three-phase motor are taken out
on slip-rings and fed a separate field current to create a continuous
magnetic field (or if the rotor consists of a permanent magnet), the
result is called a synchronous motor because the rotor will rotate in
synchronism with the rotating magnetic field produced by the polyphase
electrical supply.

The synchronous motor can also be used as an
[alternator](alternator "wikilink").

Nowadays, synchronous motors are frequently driven by transistorized
[variable-frequency drives](variable-frequency_drive "wikilink"). This
greatly eases the problem of starting the massive rotor of a large
synchronous motor. They may also be started as induction motors using a
squirrel-cage winding that shares the common rotor: once the motor
reaches synchronous speed, no current is induced in the squirrel-cage
winding so it has little effect on the synchronous operation of the
motor, aside from stabilizing the motor speed on load changes.

Synchronous motors are occasionally used as traction motors; the
[TGV](/wiki/TGV "wikilink") may be the best-known example of such use.

One use for this type of motor its use in a power factor correction
scheme. They are refered to as [synchronous
condensers](synchronous_condenser "wikilink"). This exploits a feature
of the machine where it consumes power at a leading [power
factor](power_factor "wikilink") when its rotor is over excited. It thus
appears to the supply to be a capacitor, and could thus be used to
correct the lagging power factor that is usually presented to the
electric supply by inductive loads. The excitation is adjusted until a
near unity power factor is obtained (often automatically). Machines used
for this purpose are easily identified as they had no shaft extensions.

Some of the largest AC motors are [pumped-storage
hydroelectricity](pumped-storage_hydroelectricity "wikilink") generators
that are operated as synchronous motors to pump water to a reservoir at
a higher elevation for later use to generate electricity using the same
machinery. Six 350-megawatt generators are installed in the Bath County
Pumped Storage Station in Warm Springs, VA USA. When pumping, each unit
can produce 563,400 horsepower (420,127 kilowatts).[3]

### Two-phase AC servo motors

A typical two-phase AC servo motor has a squirrel-cage rotor and a field
consisting of two windings: 1) a constant-voltage (AC) main winding, and
2) a control-voltage (AC) winding in quadrature with the main winding so
as to produce a rotating magnetic field. The electrical resistance of
the rotor is made high intentionally so that the speed-torque curve is
fairly linear. Two-phase servo motors are inherently high-speed,
low-torque devices, heavily geared down to drive the load.

### Single-phase AC induction motors

Three-phase motors inherently produce a rotating magnetic field.
However, when only single-phase power is available, the rotating
magnetic field must be produced using other means. Several methods are
commonly used.

A common single-phase motor is the [shaded-pole
motor](shaded-pole_motor "wikilink"), which is used in devices requiring
low [torque](torque "wikilink"), such as [electric
fans](electric_fan "wikilink") or other small household appliances. In
this motor, small single-turn copper "shading coils" create the moving
magnetic field. Part of each pole is encircled by a copper coil or
strap; the induced current in the strap opposes the change of flux
through the coil ([Lenz's Law](/wiki/Lenz's_Law "wikilink")), so that the
maximum field intensity moves across the pole face on each cycle, thus
producing the required rotating magnetic field.

Another common single-phase AC motor is the *split-phase induction
motor*, commonly used in [major appliances](major_appliance "wikilink")
such as [washing machines](washing_machine "wikilink") and [clothes
dryers](clothes_dryer "wikilink"). Compared to the shaded pole motor,
these motors can generally provide much greater starting torque by using
a special [startup winding](startup_winding "wikilink") in conjunction
with a [centrifugal switch](centrifugal_switch "wikilink").

In the split-phase motor, the startup winding is designed with a higher
[resistance](electrical_resistance "wikilink") than the running winding.
This creates an [LR circuit](/wiki/Lr_circuit "wikilink") which slightly
shifts the phase of the current in the startup winding. When the motor
is starting, the startup winding is connected to the power source via a
set of spring-loaded contacts pressed upon by the not-yet-rotating
centrifugal switch. The starting winding is wound with fewer turns of
smaller wire than the main winding, so it has a lower inductance (*L*)
and higher resistance (*R*). The lower *L*/*R* ratio creates a small
phase shift, not more than about 30 degrees, between the flux due to the
main winding and the flux of the starting winding. The starting
direction of rotation may be reversed simply by exchanging the
connections of the startup winding relative to the running winding.

The phase of the magnetic field in this startup winding is shifted from
the phase of the mains power, allowing the creation of a moving magnetic
field which starts the motor. Once the motor reaches near design
operating speed, the centrifugal switch activates, opening the contacts
and disconnecting the startup winding from the power source. The motor
then operates solely on the running winding. The starting winding must
be disconnected since it would increase the losses in the motor.

In a *capacitor start motor*, a starting
[capacitor](capacitor "wikilink") is inserted in series with the startup
winding, creating an [LC circuit](/wiki/LC_circuit "wikilink") which is
capable of a much greater phase shift (and so, a much greater starting
torque). The capacitor naturally adds expense to such motors.

Another variation is the *Permanent Split-Capacitor (PSC) motor* (also
known as a capacitor start and run motor). This motor operates similarly
to the capacitor-start motor described above, but there is no
centrifugal starting switch and the second winding is permanently
connected to the power source. PSC motors are frequently used in air
handlers, fans, and blowers and other cases where a variable speed is
desired. By changing taps on the running winding but keeping the load
constant, the motor can be made to run at different speeds. Also
provided all 6 winding connections are available separately, a 3 phase
motor can be converted to a capacitor start and run motor by commoning
two of the windings and connecting the third via a capacitor to act as a
start winding.

*Repulsion motors* are wound-rotor single-phase AC motors that are
similar to universal motors. In a repulsion motor, the armature brushes
are shorted together rather than connected in series with the field.
Several types of repulsion motors have been manufactured, but the
*repulsion-start induction-run* (RS-IR) motor has been used most
frequently. The RS-IR motor has a centrifugal switch that shorts all
segments of the commutator so that the motor operates as an induction
motor once it has been accelerated to full speed. RS-IR motors have been
used to provide high starting torque per ampere under conditions of cold
operating temperatures and poor source voltage regulation. Few repulsion
motors of any type are sold as of 2006.

### Single-phase AC synchronous motors

Small single-phase AC motors can also be designed with magnetized rotors
(or several variations on that idea). The rotors in these motors do not
require any induced current so they do not slip backward against the
mains frequency. Instead, they rotate synchronously with the mains
frequency. Because of their highly accurate speed, such motors are
usually used to power mechanical clocks, audio
[turntables](phonograph "wikilink"), and [tape
drives](tape_drive "wikilink"); formerly they were also much used in
accurate timing instruments such as strip-chart recorders or telescope
drive mechanisms. The [shaded-pole synchronous
motor](shaded-pole_synchronous_motor "wikilink") is one version.

Because [inertia](inertia "wikilink") makes it difficult to instantly
accelerate the rotor from stopped to synchronous speed, these motors
normally require some sort of special feature to get started. Various
designs use a small induction motor (which may share the same field
coils and rotor as the synchronous motor) or a very light rotor with a
one-way mechanism (to ensure that the rotor starts in the "forward"
direction).

Torque motors
-------------

A torque motor is a specialized form of induction motor which is capable
of operating indefinitely at stall (with the rotor blocked from turning)
without damage. In this mode, the motor will apply a steady torque to
the load (hence the name). A common application of a torque motor would
be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this
application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these
motors allow a relatively-constant light tension to be applied to the
tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads.
Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the
torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without
requiring any additional mechanics such as [gears](gear "wikilink") or
[clutches](clutch "wikilink"). In the computer world, torque motors are
used with force feedback steering wheels.

Stepper motors
--------------

Closely related in design to three-phase AC synchronous motors are
[stepper motors](stepper_motor "wikilink"), where an internal rotor
containing permanent magnets or a large iron core with salient poles is
controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched
electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross
between a DC electric motor and a [solenoid](solenoid "wikilink"). As
each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the
magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a
synchronous motor, in its application, the motor may not rotate
continuously; instead, it "steps" from one position to the next as field
windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the
sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards.

Simple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize
the field windings, leading the rotor to "[cog](cog "wikilink")" to a
limited number of positions; more sophisticated drivers can
proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the
rotors to position "between" the "cog" points and thereby rotate
extremely smoothly. Computer controlled stepper motors are one of the
most versatile forms of positioning systems, particularly when part of a
digital [servo-controlled](servomechanism "wikilink") system.

Stepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle with ease, and hence
stepper motors are used in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where
the precision they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of
the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased,
the precision limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard
drives, thus newer hard disk drives use read/write head control systems
based on [voice coils](voice_coil "wikilink").

Stepper motors were upscaled to be used in electric vehicles under the
term SRM (switched reluctance machine).

Brushless DC motors
-------------------

Many of the limitations of the classic
[commutator](commutator_(electric) "wikilink") DC motor are due to the
need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates
[friction](friction "wikilink"). At higher speeds, brushes have
increasing difficulty in maintaining contact. Brushes may bounce off the
irregularities in the commutator surface, creating sparks. This limits
the maximum speed of the machine. The current density per unit area of
the brushes limits the output of the motor. The imperfect electric
contact also causes [electrical noise](electrical_noise "wikilink").
Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator
itself is subject to wear and maintenance. The commutator assembly on a
large machine is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many
parts.

These problems are eliminated in the brushless motor. In this motor, the
mechanical "rotating switch" or commutator/brushgear assembly is
replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotor's
position. Brushless motors are typically 85-90% efficient, whereas DC
motors with brushgear are typically 75-80% efficient.

Midway between ordinary [DC](/wiki/Direct_current "wikilink") motors and
stepper motors lies the realm of the [brushless DC
motor](/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor "wikilink"). Built in a fashion very
similar to stepper motors, these often use a permanent magnet
**external** rotor, three phases of driving coils, one or more [Hall
effect sensors](/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor "wikilink") to sense the position of
the rotor, and the associated drive electronics. The coils are
activated, one phase after the other, by the drive electronics as cued
by the signals from the Hall effect sensors. In effect, they act as
three-phase synchronous motors containing their own [variable-frequency
drive](variable-frequency_drive "wikilink") electronics. A specialized
class of brushless DC motor controllers utilize EMF feedback through the
main phase connections instead of Hall effect sensors to determine
position and velocity. These motors are used extensively in electric
[radio-controlled](/wiki/Radio_control "wikilink") vehicles, and referred to
by modelists as **outrunner** motors (since the magnets are on the
outside).

Brushless DC motors are commonly used where precise speed control is
necessary, computer [disk drives](disk_drive "wikilink") or in [video
cassette recorders](video_cassette_recorder "wikilink") the spindles
within [CD](/wiki/CD "wikilink"), [CD-ROM](CD-ROM "wikilink") (etc.) drives,
and mechanisms within office products such as
[fans](fan_(implement) "wikilink"), [laser
printers](laser_printer "wikilink") and
[photocopiers](photocopier "wikilink"). They have several advantages
over conventional motors:

-   Compared to AC fans using shaded-pole motors, they are very
    efficient, running much cooler than the equivalent AC motors. This
    cool operation leads to much-improved life of the fan's
    [bearings](bearing "wikilink").
-   Without a [commutator](commutator_(electric) "wikilink") to wear
    out, the life of a DC brushless motor can be significantly longer
    compared to a DC motor using brushes and a commutator. Commutation
    also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and RF noise; without
    a commutator or brushes, a brushless motor may be used in
    electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.
-   The same Hall effect sensors that provide the commutation can also
    provide a convenient [tachometer](tachometer "wikilink") signal for
    closed-loop control (servo-controlled) applications. In fans, the
    tachometer signal can be used to derive a "fan OK" signal.
-   The motor can be easily synchronized to an internal or external
    clock, leading to precise speed control.
-   Brushless motors have no chance of sparking, unlike brushed motors,
    making them better suited to environments with volatile chemicals
    and fuels.
-   Brushless motors are usually used in small equipment such as
    computers generaly used to get rid of unwanted heat.
-   They are also very quiet motors which is an advantage if being used
    in equipment that is affected by vibrations.

Modern DC brushless motors range in power from a fraction of a
[watt](watt "wikilink") to many kilowatts. Larger brushless motors up to
about 100 kW rating are used in electric vehicles. They also find
significant use in high-performance electric model aircraft.

Coreless DC motors
------------------

Nothing in the design of any of the motors described above requires that
the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate; torque is
exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of
this fact is the **coreless DC motor**, a specialized form of a brush DC
motor. Optimized for rapid [acceleration](acceleration "wikilink"),
these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The
rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder inside the stator
magnets, a basket surrounding the stator magnets, or a flat *pancake*
(possibly formed on a [printed wiring
board](printed_wiring_board "wikilink")) running between upper and lower
stator magnets. The windings are typically stabilized by being
impregnated with [epoxy](epoxy "wikilink") resins.

Because the rotor is much lighter in weight ([mass](mass "wikilink"))
than a conventional rotor formed from [copper](copper "wikilink")
windings on [steel](steel "wikilink") laminations, the rotor can
accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical [time
constant](time_constant "wikilink") under 1
[ms](millisecond "wikilink"). This is especially true if the windings
use [aluminum](aluminium "wikilink") rather than the heavier copper. But
because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink, even
small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air.

These motors were commonly used to drive the
[capstan](capstan "wikilink")(s) of [magnetic
tape](magnetic_tape "wikilink") drives and are still widely used in
high-performance servo-controlled systems.

Linear motors
-------------

A [linear motor](linear_motor "wikilink") is essentially an electric
motor that has been "unrolled" so that, instead of producing a
[torque](torque "wikilink") (rotation), it produces a linear force along
its length by setting up a traveling electromagnetic field.

Linear motors are most commonly induction motors or stepper motors. You
can find a linear motor in a [maglev](/wiki/Maglev_train "wikilink")
([Transrapid](/wiki/Transrapid "wikilink")) train, where the train "flies"
over the ground.

Doubly-fed electric motor
-------------------------

**Doubly-fed electric motors** or [Doubly-Fed Electric
Machines](/wiki/Doubly-Fed_Electric_Machines "wikilink") have two multiphase
windings, with at least one of the winding sets electronically
controlled for synchronous operation from sub-synchronous to super
synchronous speeds. As a result, doubly-fed electric motors are
synchronous machines with an effective constant torque speed range that
is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is
twice the constant torque speed range as [Singly-Fed Electric
Machines](/wiki/Singly-Fed_Electric_Machine "wikilink"), which have only one
active winding set. In theory, this attribute has attractive cost, size,
and efficiency ramifications compared to Singly-Fed Electric Machines
but Doubly-fed motors are difficult to realize in practice.

The [Wound-Rotor Doubly-Fed Electric
Machines](/wiki/Wound-Rotor_Doubly-Fed_Electric_Machines "wikilink"), the
[Brushless Wound-Rotor Doubly-Fed Electric
Machine](/wiki/Brushless_Wound-Rotor_Doubly-Fed_Electric_Machine "wikilink"),
and the so-called [Brushless Doubly-Fed Electric
Machines](/wiki/Brushless_Doubly-Fed_Electric_Machines "wikilink") are the
only examples of synchronous doubly-fed electric machines.

Singly-fed electric motor
-------------------------

**Singly-fed electric motors** or [Singly-Fed Electric
Machines](/wiki/Singly-Fed_Electric_Machine "wikilink") incorporate a single
multiphase winding set that actively participate in the energy
conversion process (i.e., singly-fed). Singly-fed electric machines
operate under either Induction (i.e., Asynchronous) or Synchronous
principles. The active winding set can be electronically controlled for
optimum performance. Induction machines exhibit startup torque and can
operate as standalone machines but Synchronous machines must have
auxiliary means for startup and practical operation, such as an
electronic controller. Singly-fed electric machines have an effective
constant torque speed range up to synchronous speed (i.e., 3600 rpm @ 60
Hz and 2 Poles) for a given excitation frequency.

The Induction (Asynchronous) motors (i.e., squirrel cage rotor or wound
rotor), Synchronous motors (i.e., field-excited, Permanent Magnet or
brushless DC motors, Reluctance motors, etc.), which are discussed on
this page, are examples of Singly-fed motors. By far, Singly-fed motors
are the predominantly installed type of motors.

Nanotube nanomotor
------------------

![Nanomotor constructed at [UC Berkeley](/wiki/UC_Berkeley "wikilink"). The
motor is about 500nm across: 300 times smaller than the diameter of a
[human
hair](human_hair "wikilink")](Nanomotor.gif "fig:Nanomotor constructed at UC Berkeley. The motor is about 500nm across: 300 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair")
Researchers at [University of California,
Berkeley](/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "wikilink"), recently
developed rotational bearings based upon multiwall carbon nanotubes. By
attaching a gold plate (with dimensions of order 100nm) to the outer
shell of a suspended multiwall carbon nanotube (like nested carbon
cylinders), they are able to electrostatically rotate the outer shell
relative to the inner core. These bearings are very robust; devices have
been oscillated thousands of times with no indication of wear. These
nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are the next step in
miniaturization that may find their way into commercial aspects in the
future.

DC motor starters
-----------------

The [counter-emf](counter-emf "wikilink") aids the armature resistance
to limit the current through the armature. When power is first applied
to a motor, the armature does not rotate. At that instant the
[counter-emf](counter-emf "wikilink") is zero and the only factor
limiting the armature current, is the armature resistance. Usually the
armature resistance of a motor is less than one ohm; therefore the
current through the armature would be very large when the power is
applied. This current can make an excessive voltage drop affecting other
equipment in the circuit and even trip overload protective devices.

-   Therefore the need arises for an additional resistance in series
    with the armature to limit the current until the motor rotation can
    build up the counter-emf. As the motor rotation build up, the
    resistance is gradually cut out.

### Three-point starter

<img src="3ptMotorStarter.JPG" title="fig:Three point starter" alt="Three point starter" width="200" />
The incoming power is indicated as L1 and L2. The components within the
broken lines form the three-point starter. As the name implies there are
only three connections to the starter. The connections to the armature
are indicated as A1 and A2. The ends of the field (excitement) coil are
indicated as F1 and F2. In order to control the speed, A field rheostat
is connected in series with the shunt field. One side of the line is
connected to the arm of the starter (represented by an arrow in the
diagram). The arm is spring-loaded so , it will return to the "Off"
position the not held at any other position.

-   ON the first step of the arm, full line voltage is applied across
    the shunt field. Since the field rheostat is normally set to minimum
    resistance, the speed of the motor will not be excessive;
    additionally, the motor will develop a large starting torque.
-   The starter also connects an electromagnet in series with the shunt
    field. It will hold the arm in position when the arm makes contact
    with the magnet.
-   Meanwhile that voltage is applied to the shunt field, and the
    starting resistance limits the flow of current to the armature.
-   As the motor picks up speed counter-emf is built up, the arm is
    moved slowly to short.

### Four-point starter

<img src="4ptMotorStarter.JPG" title="fig:Four point starter" alt="Four point starter" width="200" />
The four-point starter eliminates the drawback of the three-point
starter. In addition to the same three points that were in use with the
three-point starter, the other side of the line, L1, is the fourth point
brought to the starter when the arm is moved from the "Off" position.
The coil of the holding magnet is connected across the line. The holding
magnet and starting resistors function identical as in the three-point
starter.

-   The possibility of accidentally opening the field circuit is quite
    remote. The four-point starter provides the no-voltage protection to
    the motor. If the power fails, the motor is disconnected from the
    line.
