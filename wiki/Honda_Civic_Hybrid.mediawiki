==Technology==
===1st Generation (2003-2005 Model)===

* 1.3&nbsp;L i-DSI [[Lean burn|lean-burn]] [[internal-combustion engine]] with [[VTEC]] Cylinder Cut-off System, which allows up to three cylinders to cease operation during deceleration. This decreases friction losses generated by engine aspiration and allows more effective regeneration of energy.
* 15&nbsp;kW (20&nbsp;hp) brushless, permanent magnet assist [[electric motor|motor]], which functions as a [[electrical generator|generator]] during deceleration and loads (recharges) batteries
* 120&nbsp;V [[NiMH|Nickel-metal hydride]] [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] with 6.0&nbsp;Ah capacity
* [[Honda Multimatic S|Multimatic S]] continuously variable or 5-speed manual [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] (latter available only in USA)
* [[SULEV]] or optional [[AT-PZEV]] certification by the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB)
* Low rolling resistance [[tire]]s and [[regenerative braking]]
* [[Electric power-steering]]
* Does not need to be plugged in

===2nd Generation (2006-2007 Model)===
:Note: only advancements specified, those items remaining the same not mentioned.
*4th generation IMA (Integrated Motor Assist)
*1.3&nbsp;L single-overhead-cam four-cylinder gas engine same as before; yet, there is now the addition of high profile camshaft. This increases power to 93&nbsp;hp @ 6000&nbsp;rpm
*Addition of third stage of i-VTEC and VCM (Vehicle Cylinder Management) permits deactivation of all four cylinders when decelerating and constant cruising. This allows the car to run only on electric power for the first time.

*EPA increase to 49&nbsp;mpg city, 51&nbsp;mpg highway
