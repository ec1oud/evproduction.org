The OSBP4EVs is an attempt to gather the expertise of many to design low
cost battery solutions for Electric Vehicles and Hybrids, in a good
solid 'Open Source' design.

The primary goal will be to design car sized batteries using cheap off
the [shelf cells](shelf_cell "wikilink") such as [Lithium
Ion](/wiki/Lithium_Ion "wikilink") or [Nickel Metal
Hydride](/wiki/Nickel_Metal_Hydride "wikilink"), for building batteries for
much less than they are being sold.

It addition a suitable [charger](charger "wikilink")/[battery management
system](battery_management_system "wikilink") needs to be designed that
can charge and maintain these packs.

We feel that inexpensive [DIY](wikipedia:DIY "wikilink") batteries of
this type will give home built EV and Hybrid vehicles greater range and
provide more options for the builders.

Also you will have the opportunity to understand the battery, chargers
and battery managements systems better than ever.
