***Who Killed the Electric Car?*** is a [2006](2006_in_film "wikilink")
[documentary film](documentary_film "wikilink") that explores the birth,
limited commercialization, and subsequent death of the [battery electric
vehicle](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") in the [United
States](/wiki/United_States "wikilink"), specifically the [General Motors
EV1](/wiki/General_Motors_EV1 "wikilink") of the 1990s. The film explores the
roles of [automobile manufacturers](automobile_manufacturer "wikilink"),
the [oil industry](oil_industry "wikilink"), the [US
government](/wiki/US_government "wikilink"),
[batteries](batteries "wikilink"), [hydrogen
vehicles](/wiki/Hydrogen_(car) "wikilink"), and
[consumers](consumer "wikilink") in limiting the development and
adoption of this technology.

It was released on [DVD](/wiki/DVD "wikilink") to the home video market on
[November 14](/wiki/November_14 "wikilink") [2006](2006 "wikilink") by [Sony
Pictures Home
Entertainment](/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Home_Entertainment "wikilink").

Topics addressed
----------------

The film deals with the history of the electric car, its development and
commercialization, mostly focusing on the [General Motors
EV1](/wiki/General_Motors_EV1 "wikilink"), which was made available for
[lease](lease "wikilink") in [Southern
California](/wiki/Southern_California "wikilink"), after the [California Air
Resources Board](/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board "wikilink") passed the
[ZEV](/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle "wikilink") mandate in
[1990](1990 "wikilink"), as well as the implications of the events
depicted for [air pollution](air_pollution "wikilink"),
[environmentalism](environmentalism "wikilink"), [Middle
East](/wiki/Middle_East "wikilink") politics, and [global
warming](global_warming "wikilink").

The film details the [California Air Resources
Board](/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board "wikilink")'s reversal of the
mandate after suits from [automobile
manufacturers](automobile_manufacturer "wikilink"), the [oil
industry](oil_industry "wikilink"), and the [George W. Bush
administration](/wiki/George_W._Bush_administration "wikilink"). It points out
that Bush's chief influences, [Dick Cheney](/wiki/Dick_Cheney "wikilink"),
[Condoleezza Rice](/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice "wikilink"), and [Andrew
Card](/wiki/Andrew_Card "wikilink"), are all former executives and board
members of oil and auto companies.

Motors](/wiki/General_Motors "wikilink") shortly after

A large part of the film accounts for GM's efforts to demonstrate to
California that there was no demand for their product, and then to take
back every EV1 and dispose of them. A few were disabled and given to
museums and universities, but almost all were found to have been
crushed; GM never responded to the EV drivers' offer to pay the residual
lease value ($1.9 million was offered for the remaining 79 cars in
Burbank before they were crushed). Several activists are shown being
arrested in the protest that attempted to block the GM car carriers
taking the remaining EV1s off to be crushed.

The film explores some of the reasons that the auto and oil industries
worked to kill off the electric car. [Wally
Rippel](/wiki/Wally_Rippel "wikilink") is shown explaining that the oil
companies were afraid of losing out on trillions in potential profit
from their transportation fuel monopoly over the coming decades, while
the auto companies were afraid of losses over the next six months of EV
production. Others explained the killing differently. GM spokesman Dave
Barthmuss argued it was lack of consumer interest due to the maximum
range of 80–100 miles per charge, and the relatively high price.

The film also explores the future of automobile technologies including a
deeply critical look at [hydrogen vehicles](hydrogen_vehicle "wikilink")
and an upbeat discussion of [plug-in hybrid electric
vehicle](plug-in_hybrid_electric_vehicle "wikilink") technologies.

Interviews
----------

The film features interviews with celebrities such as [Mel
Gibson](/wiki/Mel_Gibson "wikilink"), [Tom Hanks](Tom_Hanks "wikilink"),
[Alexandra Paul](/wiki/Alexandra_Paul "wikilink"), [Peter
Horton](/wiki/Peter_Horton "wikilink"), [Phyllis
Diller](/wiki/Phyllis_Diller "wikilink"), and [Ed Begley,
Jr.](/wiki/Ed_Begley,_Jr. "wikilink"), a bi-partisan selection of prominent
political figures including [Ralph Nader](/wiki/Ralph_Nader "wikilink"),
[Frank Gaffney](/wiki/Frank_Gaffney "wikilink"), Alan Lloyd, Jim Boyd, [Alan
Lowenthal](/wiki/Alan_Lowenthal "wikilink"), and ex-CIA head [James
Woolsey](/wiki/R._James_Woolsey "wikilink"), as well as news footage from the
development, launch and marketing of EV's.

The film also features interviews with some of the engineers and
technicians who led the development of modern [electric
vehicles](electric_vehicles "wikilink") and related technologies such as
[Wally Rippel](/wiki/Wally_Rippel "wikilink"), [Chelsea
Sexton](/wiki/Chelsea_Sexton "wikilink"), [Alan
Cocconi](/wiki/AC_Propulsion "wikilink") and [Stan and Iris
Ovshinsky](/wiki/Stan_Ovshinsky "wikilink") and other experts, such as [Joseph
J. Romm](/wiki/Joseph_J._Romm "wikilink") (author of *[Hell and High
Water](/wiki/Hell_and_High_Water "wikilink")* and *[The Hype about
Hydrogen](/wiki/The_Hype_about_Hydrogen "wikilink")*). Also featured in the
film are spokesmen for the automakers, such as GM's Dave Barthmuss, a
vocal opponent of the film and the [EV1](/wiki/General_Motors_EV1 "wikilink"),
and Bill Reinert from [Toyota](/wiki/Toyota "wikilink").

The suspects
------------

The last half hour of the movie is organized around the following
hypothesized culprits in the downfall of the electric car:

Consumers  
Lots of ambivalence to new technology, unwillingness to compromise on
decreased range and increased cost for improvements to air quality and
reduction of dependence on foreign oil. Although these allegations are
made about consumers by industry reps in the film, perhaps explaining
the film's "guilty" verdict, the actual consumers interviewed in the
film were either unaware an electric car was available, or dismayed that
they could no longer obtain one.

<!-- -->

Batteries  
Limited range (60-70 miles) and reliability in the first EV-1s to ship,
but better (110 - 160 miles) later. Towards the end of the film, an
engineer explains that, as of the interview, the same technology
available in laptop batteries would have allowed the EV-1 to be upgraded
to a range of 300 miles per charge.

<!-- -->

Oil companies  
Fearful of losing business to a competing technology, they supported
efforts to kill the ZEV mandate. They have also [bought patents to
prevent modern batteries from being used in US electric
cars.](/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle#Incentives,_quotas,_and_patent_control_in_the_US "wikilink")

<!-- -->

Car companies  
Negative marketing, sabotaging their own product program, failure to
produce cars to meet existing demand, unusual business practices with
regards to leasing versus sales. The film only explains this behavior
once, saying that electric cars needed fewer expensive repairs and would
hence not make the car companies as much money over the long term as
gasoline-powered cars. The film also describes the history of automaker
efforts to destroy competing technologies, such as their destruction
through front companies of public transit systems in the United States
in the early 20th century. It also, in one interview, mentions that
automakers introduced important safety and emissions innovations
including seat belts, airbags and catalytic converters only when forced
by government legislation.

<!-- -->

Government  
The federal government joined in the auto industry suit against
California, has failed to act in the public interest to limit pollution
and require increased fuel economy, has promoted the purchase of
vehicles with poor fuel efficiency through preferential tax breaks, and
has redirected alternative fuel research from electric towards hydrogen.

<!-- -->

California Air Resources Board  
The [CARB](/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board "wikilink"), headed by Alan
Lloyd, caved to industry pressure and repealed the ZEV mandate. Lloyd
was given the directorship of the new fuel cell institute, creating an
inherent conflict of interest. Footage shot in the meetings showed how
he shut down the ZEV proponents while giving the car makers all the time
they wanted to make their points.

<!-- -->

Hydrogen fuel cell  
The [hydrogen fuel cell](hydrogen_fuel_cell "wikilink") was presented by
the film as an alternative that distracts attention from the real and
immediate potential of electric vehicles to an unlikely future
possibility embraced by automakers, oil companies and a pro-business
administration in order to buy time and profits for the status quo.

Criticisms
----------

The film has been criticized for some of its suggestions.

### From General Motors

[General Motors](/wiki/General_Motors "wikilink") (GM) has responded through a
blog post entitled [*Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric
Car?*](http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html)
by Dave Barthmuss of their communications department. He does not
address the movie directly, since he claims not to have seen it, but
tells GM's side of the story, about their big investment before and
since the EV1, the limited market in spite of their efforts, and how
they maybe could have handled the decommissioning better. A quote:

> Sadly, despite the substantial investment of money and the
> enthusiastic fervor of a relatively small number of EV1 drivers —
> including the filmmaker — the EV1 proved far from a viable commercial
> success.

He notes investments in electric vehicle technology since the EV1:
[Two-Mode Hybrid](/wiki/Two-Mode_Hybrid "wikilink"), plug-in hybrid, and fuel
cell vehicle programs. The filmmakers suggested that GM did not
immediately channel its technological progress with the EV1 into these
projects, and instead let the technology languish while focusing on more
immediately profitable enterprises such as SUVs.

Unlike the movie, GM is bullish on hydrogen, according to Barthmuss:

> Although hydrogen fuel cell technology was cast as a pie-in-the-sky
> technology by the moviemakers, GM is making great progress in fuel
> cell research and development and is on track to achieving its goal to
> validate and design a fuel cell propulsion system by 2010 that is
> competitive with current combustion systems on durability and
> performance, and that ultimately can be built at scale, affordably.

### Critical rebuttal of GM

The movie pointed out that General Motors' customer survey may have
served to lower demand. GM called interested customers and emphasized
drawbacks to the car that were disputed by EV1 drivers. CARB officials
have been quoted claiming that they removed their zero emission vehicle
quotas in part because such surveys purported to show that no demand
existed for the EV1s. Critics interviewed in the movie contend that the
cost of batteries and electric vehicles would have been reduced
significantly when mass production began, due to [economies of
scale](economies_of_scale "wikilink").

### From Edmunds.com

Karl Brauer, editor-in-chief of [Edmunds.com](/wiki/Edmunds.com "wikilink"), a
popular auto market web site, wrote his own criticism of the
movie[1],contrasting the interpretations in the movie with his own in a
rumor/fact format. For example, regarding how GM negatively marketed the
car, he said:

  
'' **Rumor:** There were 5,000 people who wanted an EV1, but GM wouldn't
let them buy it.''

<!-- -->

  
'' **Fact:** There were 5,000 people who expressed interest in an EV1,
but when GM called them back and explained that the car cost $299-plus a
month to lease, went between 60 and 80 miles on a full charge, and took
between 45 minutes and 15 hours to re-charge, very few would commit to
leasing one (not too surprising, is it?). The film likes to quote a
figure of 29 miles as the average American's daily driving needs, but
that is a national figure and the EV1 was only sold in California and
Arizona, primarily in Los Angeles. Anyone wanna guess what the average
L.A. resident's daily driving need is? I'm betting it's higher than that
national average....''

Reviews
-------

[Metacritic](/wiki/Metacritic "wikilink") gives it a
70[1](http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/whokilledtheelectriccar?q=who%20killed%20the%20electric%20car),
indicating generally favorable reviews.

With brief quotes.

-   [NY Times review of the
    film](http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=338763)
    by Manohla Dargis

  
"It's a story Mr. Paine tells with bite. In 1996 a Los Angeles newspaper
reported that 'the air board grew doubtful about the willingness of
consumers to accept the cars, which carry steep price tags and have a
limited travel range.' Mr. Paine pushes beyond this ostensibly
disinterested report, suggesting that one reason the board might have
grown doubtful was because its chairman at the time, Alan C. Lloyd, had
joined the California Fuel Cell Partnership."

<!-- -->

  
The sequence is not correctly represented here, but the point of Alan
Lloyd's conflict of interest is one made in the film.

-   [Hollywood Reporter
    Review](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002729006)
    by Michael Rechtshaffen

  
"Boasting a particularly articulate and colorful bunch of noncelebrity
talking heads, including former Jimmy Carter energy adviser S. David
Freeman and Bill Reinert, the straight-shooting national manager of
advanced technologies for Toyota who doesn't exactly sing the praises of
the much-touted hydrogen fuel cell, the lively film maintains its
challenging pace."

-   [Film Threat review from the Sundance Film
    Festival](http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&Id=8463)
    by Pete Vonder Haar

  
"Like most documentaries, 'Who Killed the Electric Car?' works best when
it sticks to the facts. Showing us the details about the California Air
Resources Board caving in to the automakers and repealing their 1990
Zero Emissions Mandate, for example, is much more effective than
coverage of some goofy mock funeral for the EV-1 with Ed Begley Jr.
providing the eulogy."

-   [Review in OC
    weekly](http://www.ocweekly.com/web/web/baby-you-can-still-drive-my-electric-car/25134/)
    by Matt Coker,

  
"As most of the lazy media, prodded by the shameless oil men in the
White House, spin their wheels over false 'solutions' like hybrids and
biodiesel and hydrogen and ethanol and ANWAR, Korthof and his
all-electric army continue to boost EV technology."

<!-- -->

  
It's not really a review of the movie, but previews it, and includes an
interview with EV activist Doug Korthof who says:

<!-- -->

  
"We don't deserve the catastrophe in Iraq, and the two madmen arguing
over oil supply lines seem intent on martyrdom for Iraq in a widening
war. With EV, we need not get involved in seizing and defending the oil
supplies of the Mideast; nor need we maintain fleets, bomb and
incarcerate people we can't stand, give foreign aid to oily dictators,
and so on. It's not anything to laugh about."
