A **hybrid vehicle** (HV) is a vehicle that uses two or more distinct
power or fuel sources such as:

-   An on-board [rechargeable energy storage
    system](rechargeable_energy_storage_system "wikilink") (RESS) and a
    fueled power source for vehicle
    [propulsion](/wiki/Ground_propulsion "wikilink")
-   Human powered bicycle with battery assist
-   A sail boat with electric
    power[1](http://www.autobloggreen.com/2006/11/28/heard-of-regenerative-braking-how-about-regenerative-sailing/)

The term most commonly refers to **Hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV)** which
includes [internal combustion](internal_combustion "wikilink") engines
(if uses petroleum, it´s called a a [hybrid-electric petroleum
vehicle](hybrid-electric_petroleum_vehicle "wikilink")) and [electric
motors](electric_motor "wikilink") (generally powered by [electric
batteries](electric_battery "wikilink")). See also "[Hybrid Vehicle
Drivetrains](/wiki/Hybrid_Vehicle_Drivetrains "wikilink")" and ["List of
hybrid vehicles"](/wiki/List_of_hybrid_vehicles "wikilink").

History
-------

One of the earliest hybrid vehicles were simply boats with both sails
and oars, such as the [Greek/Phoenician trireme
warships](/wiki/Trireme "wikilink"). These used a sail for traveling with the
wind, and the oars for when there was insufficient wind, or in
circumstances that the sail was unfavorable (such as naval combat, in
the case of the triremes).

Core segment in the market
--------------------------

Hybrids are viewed by some [automakers](automaker "wikilink") as a core
segment of the future vehicle market .[1]

Two-wheeled and cycle-type vehicles
-----------------------------------

[Mopeds](/wiki/Moped "wikilink") and [electric
bicycles](/wiki/Motorized_bicycles "wikilink") are a simple form of a hybrid,
as power is delivered both via an [internal combustion
engine](internal_combustion "wikilink") or [electric
motor](electric_motor "wikilink") and the rider's muscles.

-   In a **parallel hybrid bicycle** human and motor power are
    mechanically coupled at the pedal drive train or at the rear or the
    front wheel, e.g. using a hub motor, a roller pressing onto a tire,
    or a connection to a wheel using a transmission element. Human and
    motor torques are added together. Almost all manufactured models are
    of this type. See [Motorized
    bicycles](/wiki/Motorized_bicycles "wikilink"), [Mopeds](/wiki/Moped "wikilink")
    and [2] for more information.

<!-- -->

-   In a **series hybrid bicycle** (SH) the user powers a generator
    using the pedals. This is converted into electricity and can be fed
    directly to the motor giving a [chainless
    bicycle](chainless_bicycle "wikilink") but also to charge a battery.
    The motor draws power from the battery and must be able to deliver
    the full mechanical torque required because none is available from
    the pedals. SH bicycles are not yet commercially available. They
    will become feasible if extremely high-efficiency generators and
    motors are available at competitive prices, especially for recumbent
    bicycles and tandems, where problems associated with the complexity
    of a long chain drive can be avoided. [3].

  
  
The first known prototype and publication of a SH bicycle is by Augustus
Kinzel (US Patent 3'884'317) in 1975. In 1994 Bernie Macdonalds
conceived the [Electrilite](http://www.mcn.org/a/omni/ELiteBro95.htm) SH
lightweight vehicle which used power electronics allowing regenerative
braking and pedaling while stationary. In 1995 Thomas Müller designed a
"Fahrrad mit elektromagnetischem Antrieb" in his 1995 diploma thesis and
built a functional vehicle. In 1996 Jürg Blatter and Andreas Fuchs of
Berne University of Applied Sciences built a SH bicycle and in 1998
mounted the system onto a [Leitra](/wiki/Leitra "wikilink") tricycle (European
patent EP 1165188). In 1999 Harald Kutzke described his concept of the
"active bicycle": the aim is to approach the ideal bicycle weighing
nothing and having no drag by electronic compensation. Until 2005 Fuchs
and colleagues built several prototype SH tricycles and quadricycles.

Heavy vehicles
--------------

Hybrid [power trains](power_train "wikilink") are used for
[diesel-electric](diesel-electric "wikilink") or
[turbo-electric](turbo-electric "wikilink") railway locomotives, buses,
heavy goods vehicles, mobile [hydraulic
machinery](hydraulic_machinery "wikilink"), and ships. Some form of heat
engine drives an electric generator or hydraulic pump which power one or
several electric or hydraulic motors. There are advantages in
distributing power through wires or pipes rather than mechanical
elements especially when multiple drives - e.g. driven wheels or
propellers - are required. There are disadvantages due to the power lost
in the double conversion. With large vehicles the advantages often
outweigh especially as the relative conversion losses decrease with
size. Generally there is no or relatively little energy storage
capacity, e.g. auxiliary and emergency batteries and [hydraulic
accumulators](hydraulic_accumulator "wikilink").

Hybrid-electric petroleum vehicles
----------------------------------

![Hybrid [New Flyer](/wiki/New_Flyer "wikilink")
[Metrobus](/wiki/Metrobus "wikilink")\|300px](Hybrid-bus.jpg "fig:Hybrid New Flyer Metrobus|300px")
When the term *hybrid vehicle* is used, it most often refers to a
[Petroleum electric hybrid
vehicle](/wiki/Petroleum_electric_hybrid_vehicle "wikilink"). These encompass
such vehicles as the [Toyota Prius](/wiki/Toyota_Prius "wikilink"), [Toyota
Camry Hybrid](/wiki/Toyota_Camry_Hybrid "wikilink"), [Ford Escape
Hybrid](/wiki/Ford_Escape_Hybrid "wikilink"), [Honda
Insight](/wiki/Honda_Insight "wikilink") and others. A petroleum-electric
hybrid most commonly uses [internal
combustion](internal_combustion "wikilink") engines (generally gasoline
or [Diesel engines](/wiki/Diesel_engine "wikilink"), powered by a variety of
fuels) and [electric batteries](electric_battery "wikilink") to power
[electric motors](electric_motor "wikilink"). There are many [types of
petroleum-electric hybrid
drivetrains](/wiki/Hybrid_Vehicle_Drivetrains "wikilink") from **Full hybrid**
to [Mild hybrid](/wiki/Mild_hybrid "wikilink") which offer varying advantages
and disadvantages [4].

Hybrid fuel (dual mode)
-----------------------

In addition to vehicles that use two or more different devices for
[propulsion](/wiki/Ground_propulsion "wikilink"), some also consider vehicles
that use distinct energy input types ("[fuels](fuel "wikilink")") using
the same tank and engine to be hybrids, although to avoid confusion with
hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms, these are
described as [dual mode](dual_mode "wikilink") vehicles:

-   Some [electric trolleybuses](electric_trolleybus "wikilink") can
    switch between an on board [diesel engine](diesel_engine "wikilink")
    and overhead electrical power depending on conditions (see [dual
    mode bus](dual_mode_bus "wikilink")). In principle, this could be
    combined with a battery subsystem to create a true plug-in hybrid
    trolleybus, although [as of 2006](as_of_2006 "wikilink"), no such
    design seems to have been announced.
-   [Flexible-fuel vehicles](/wiki/Flexible-fuel_vehicle "wikilink") can use a
    mixture of input fuels (petroleum and
    [biofuels](biofuel "wikilink")) in one tank — typically
    [gasoline](gasoline "wikilink") and
    [bioethanol](bioethanol "wikilink") or
    [biobutanol](biobutanol "wikilink"), though
    diesel-[biodiesel](biodiesel "wikilink") vehicles would also
    qualify. [Liquified petroleum
    gas](/wiki/Liquified_petroleum_gas "wikilink") and [natural
    gas](natural_gas "wikilink") are very different from each other and
    cannot be used in the same tanks, so it would be impossible to build
    an (LPG-NG) flexible fuel system.
-   Some vehicles have been modified to use another fuel source if it is
    available, such as cars modified to run on [autogas
    (LPG)](/wiki/Autogas "wikilink") and diesels modified to run on [waste
    vegetable oil](waste_vegetable_oil "wikilink") that has not been
    processed into bio-diesel.
-   Power-assist mechanisms for [bicycles](bicycle "wikilink") and other
    [human](human "wikilink")-powered vehicles are also included.
-   A [Plug-in hybrid](/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid "wikilink") electric vehicles
    (PHEV) is an emerging type of automobile which can use traditional
    liquid combustibles and electricity as fuels. Such vehicles could
    reduce fossil fuel consumption, pollution, and operating costs. If
    equipped with [vehicle to grid](vehicle_to_grid "wikilink")
    technology they could also help stabilize the [electric
    grid](electric_grid "wikilink") by acting as load balance devices.
    By reducing the amount of liquid fuel required they could also help
    [biofuels](biofuel "wikilink") meet a larger portion of our fuel
    demands.

Continuously Recharged [Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)](/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given suitable infrastructure, BEVs can be **recharged** **while the
user drives**. The [BEV](/wiki/BEV "wikilink") establishes contact with an
electrified rail, plate or overhead wires on the highway via an attached
conducting wheel or other similar mechanism (see [Conduit current
collection](/wiki/Conduit_current_collection "wikilink")). The BEV's batteries
are recharged by this process - on the highway - and can then be used
normally on other roads.

This provides the advantage of **virtually unrestricted highway**
**range**. Since most destinations are within 100 km of a major highway,
this **reduces the need for expensive battery systems**.

The technology for such infrastructure is old and well established -
(see [Conduit current
collection](/wiki/Conduit_current_collection "wikilink"),
[trams](trams "wikilink"), [electric rail](electric_rail "wikilink"),
[trolleys](/wiki/Tram "wikilink"), [third rail](third_rail "wikilink")).
Electricity and infrastructure costs can be funded by toll revenue,
gasoline taxes or other sources.
