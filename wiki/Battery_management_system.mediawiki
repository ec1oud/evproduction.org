A '''battery regulator''' is a device in a [[battery pack]] which bleeds off excess charge current to allow all cells or batteries in a string to be fully charged without overcharging other cells.  Since they may all reach full charge at different times because of differences in capacity due to age, a regulator keeps all the batteries or cells in balance.  They are most effective during periodic full charge events performed to PbA battery packs by holding down the finishing voltage preventing weak cells from overcharging and gassing. Regulators do not actively balance batteries by shuttling power during operation like a [[battery balancer]] does, a balancer may further extend a packs lifespan.

Regulators are most often used in [[battery electric vehicle|BEV]] battery packs to prolong the packs' useful lifespan.
