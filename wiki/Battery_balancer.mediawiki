A '''battery balancer''' is a device in a [[battery pack]] which can actively shuttle energy into a weak cell from other more healthy cells in the pack, they may also include the function of a [[battery regulator]] to prevent overcharging.  Balancers are often found in [[Lithium ion battery]] packs for cell phones and laptop computers. They can also be found in [[battery electric vehicle|BEV]] battery packs.

A full [[Battery Management System]] (BMS) might include active balancing as well as temperature monitoring, charging, and other features to maximize the life of a battery pack.

Lee Hart has designed and makes available kits for an 80 cell/battery programmable balancer.
