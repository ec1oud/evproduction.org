The OSBP4EVs is an attempt to gather the expertise of many to design low cost battery solutions for Electric Vehicles and Hybrids, in a good solid 'Open Source' design.

The primary goal will be to design car sized batteries using cheap off the [[shelf cell]]s such as [[Lithium Ion]] or [[Nickel Metal Hydride]], for building batteries for much less than they are being sold. 

It addition a suitable [[charger]]/[[battery management system]] needs to be designed that can charge and maintain these packs.

We feel that inexpensive [[wikipedia:DIY|DIY]] batteries of this type will give home built EV and Hybrid vehicles greater range and provide more options for the builders.

Also you will have the opportunity to understand the battery, chargers and battery managements systems better than ever.
