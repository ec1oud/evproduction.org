**Green tuned** cars are cars that have been
[tuned](car_tuning "wikilink") to use initial or deeper [alternative
propulsion](alternative_propulsion "wikilink").

Types of green tunning includes:

-   [Electric vehicle
    conversion](/wiki/Electric_vehicle_conversion "wikilink"). An electric
    vehicle conversion is the modification of a conventional internal
    combustion engine (ICE) driven vehicle to battery electric
    propulsion, creating a battery electric vehicle. In some cases the
    vehicle may be built by the converter, or assembled from a [kit
    car](kit_car "wikilink"). In some countries, the user can choose to
    buy a converted vehicle of any model in the automaker dealerships
    only paying the cost of the batteries and motor, with no
    installation costs (it is called preconversion or previous
    conversion).
-   [Hybridization](/wiki/Hybridization "wikilink"): change to a [hybrid
    electric vehicle](hybrid_electric_vehicle "wikilink"). One can use
    an [aftermarket](aftermarket "wikilink") kit for the
    [powertrain](powertrain "wikilink") or use a [hybrid
    adapter](hybrid_adapter "wikilink") trailer.
-   [Pluginization](/wiki/Pluginization "wikilink") of hybrid cars. A plug-in
    hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid which has additional
    battery capacity and the ability to be recharged from an external
    electrical outlet. In addition, modifications are made to the
    vehicle's control software. The vehicle can be used for short trips
    of moderate speed without needing the internal combustion engine
    (ICE) component of the vehicle, thereby saving fuel costs. In this
    mode of operation the vehicle operates as a pure battery electric
    vehicle with a weight penalty (the ICE). The long range and
    additional power of the ICE power train is available when needed.
-   [Alternation to a different
    fuel](/wiki/Alternation_to_a_different_fuel "wikilink"): this mostly
    includes a change to vegetable oil, or any alcohols (ethanol or
    methanol). Like Pluginization and hybridization, this tuning does
    not however make the vehicle a zero-emissions vehicle.
