-   here is a good summary page on
    [suspension](http://www.chris-longhurst.com/carbibles/index.html?menu.html&suspension_bible.html)
    types.
-   Sliding Pillar suspension: here is the [Morgan trike Sliding
    Pillar](http://morgan3w.de/technic/technic.htm) front suspension.
    Also a picture of the
    [locost7](http://locost7.info/files/suspension/Robin+Hood+Sliding+Pillar.jpg),
    front suspension. Locost7 is apparently a Lotus 7 home built.
