![Battery balancer](Lipoly_equalizer.jpg "Battery balancer")

A **battery balancer** is a device in a [battery
pack](battery_pack "wikilink") which can actively shuttle energy into a
weak cell from other more healthy cells in the pack, they may also
include the function of a [battery
regulator](battery_regulator "wikilink") to prevent overcharging.
Balancers are often found in [Lithium ion
battery](/wiki/Lithium_ion_battery "wikilink") packs for cell phones and
laptop computers. They can also be found in
[BEV](battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") battery packs.

A full [Battery Management System](/wiki/Battery_Management_System "wikilink")
(BMS) might include active balancing as well as temperature monitoring,
charging, and other features to maximize the life of a battery pack.

Lee Hart has designed and makes available kits for an 80 cell/battery
programmable balancer.
