'''Rechargeable alkaline battery''' is a type of [[alkaline battery]] that is [[rechargeable]]. The shapes include [[AAA battery|AAA]], [[AA battery]], C, D and snap-on 9-volt batteries. People who use small-sized or portable devices powered on batteries often will use these type of batteries. [[Rayovac]] produced a variety of rechargeable batteries called Renewal. They required a special charger which could only charge this type of battery. Rayovac discontinued these products,{{Fact|date=May 2007}} but other rechargeable alkaline batteries are still available from other vendors, as well as other types of rechargeable batteries in the alkaline battery form factor. Some types of battery chargers are able to recharge these batteries as well as [[NiCd]] and [[NiMH]], provided that the charger only has one type in it at any one time.

Some claim that it is indeed possible to recharge a regular non-rechargeable alkaline battery under the right conditions and using the right type of current; however, this is not recommended due to risk of explosion and leakage.  There is a charger available called the Battery Xtender[http://www.batteryxtender.com/], which is specially designed to recharge ordinary alkaline batteries, in addition to NiCd and NiMH.  Under ideal conditions it's supposed to recharge regular alkalines up to 10 or 15 times, though in practice five recharges is more common (after which they start to leak).{{Fact|date=May 2007}}
