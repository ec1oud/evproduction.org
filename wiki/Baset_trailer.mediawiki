Baset trailers and removable batteries follows the principle of '''replacing instead of recharging'''.

A '''baset trailer''' is a range extending device for use with [[battery electric vehicle]]s consisting of a [[battery pack]] mounted in a [[trailer]].  The batteries (i.e.[http://enviromotors.com/wiki/index.php/Sparrow/Batteries "D34M" Optima Blue-Top and Yellow-Top batteries]) can be [[wikt:replace|replace]]d by recharged ones. Most small to midsized passenger vehicles would require 15 to 20 [[wikipedia:kW|kW]]. Larger vehicles could require 30 kW or more of power depending on how heavy and/or un-aerodynamic they happen to be. 

They can be also used with [[electric bus]]es: bus companies can store recharged batteries in route strategic points ([[wikipedia:bus station|bus station]]s, [[wikipedia:filling station|filling station]]s, [[wikipedia:parking lot|parking lot]]s, [[wikipedia:electric utility|electric utility]] facilities, ad-hoc facilities or shops and so on).

In [[wikipedia:renting|renting]], the maintenance costs of baset trailers can be deferred to the lessor or agency. They are can also be given for rent.

== Removable individual batteries  and trays ==
Batteries can be mounted in a light, easy and accesible [[removable tray]]s or individually, so one can replace only some batteries when discharged, instead of a trailer.

Users that continuously are travelling in the same route, can leave discharged battery in any point at 1/4 of the route, and to gather it when recharged to the return.
