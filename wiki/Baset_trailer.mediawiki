Baset trailers and removable batteries follows the principle of '''replacing instead of recharging'''.

A '''baset trailer''' is a range extending device for use with [[battery electric vehicle]]s consisting of a [[battery pack]] mounted in a [[trailer]].  The batteries (i.e.[http://enviromotors.com/wiki/index.php/Sparrow/Batteries "D34M" Optima Blue-Top and Yellow-Top batteries]) can be [[wikt:replace|replace]]d by recharged ones. Most small to midsized passenger vehicles would require 15 to 20 [[wikipedia:kW|kW]]. Larger vehicles could require 30 kW or more of power depending on how heavy and/or un-aerodynamic they happen to be. 

They can be also used with [[electric bus]]es: bus companies can store recharged batteries in route strategic points ([[wikipedia:bus station|bus station]]s, [[filling station]]s, [[wikipedia:parking lot|parking lot]]s, [[wikipedia:electric utility|electric utility]] facilities, ad-hoc facilities or shops and so on).

In [[wikipedia:renting|renting]], the maintenance costs of baset trailers can be deferred to the lessor or agency. They are can also be given for rent.

== Removable trays ==
Batteries can be mounted in a light, easy and accesible [[removable tray]]s, so one can replace only some batteries when discharged, instead of all the trailer.
