**Global warming** is the increase in the [average
temperature](/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record "wikilink") of the Earth's
near-surface air and [oceans](ocean "wikilink") in recent decades and
its projected continuation.

Global average air temperature near the Earth's surface rose 0.74
[±](/wiki/Plus-minus_sign "wikilink") 0.18 °[C](Celsius "wikilink") (1.3 ±
0.32 °[F](/wiki/Fahrenheit "wikilink")) during the past century. The
[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change](/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change "wikilink") (IPCC)
concludes, "most of the observed increase in globally averaged
temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely [due
to](/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change "wikilink") the observed
increase in [anthropogenic](anthropogenic "wikilink") greenhouse gas
concentrations,"[1] which leads to warming of the surface and lower
atmosphere by increasing the [greenhouse
effect](greenhouse_effect "wikilink"). Natural phenomena such as [solar
variation](solar_variation "wikilink") combined with
[volcanoes](volcano "wikilink") have probably had a small warming effect
from pre-industrial times to 1950, but a cooling effect since 1950.[2]
The basic conclusions have been endorsed by at least 30 [scientific
societies and academies of
science](/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change "wikilink"), including all
of the national academies of science of the [major industrialized
countries](/wiki/G8 "wikilink"). The [American Association of Petroleum
Geologists](/wiki/American_Association_of_Petroleum_Geologists "wikilink") is
the only scientific society that rejects these conclusions,[3][4][5]
although a comparatively small number of [individual
scientists](/wiki/Scientists_opposing_the_mainstream_scientific_assessment_of_global_warming "wikilink")
do disagree with parts of them[6].

Climate models referenced by the IPCC project that global surface
temperatures are likely to increase by between 1990 and 2100.[7] The
range of values reflects the use of differing
[scenarios](/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios "wikilink") of future
[greenhouse gas](greenhouse_gas "wikilink") emissions and results of
models with differences in [climate
sensitivity](climate_sensitivity "wikilink"). Although most studies
focus on the period up to 2100, warming and sea level rise are expected
to continue for more than a millennium even if greenhouse gas levels are
stabilized.[8] This reflects the large heat capacity of the oceans.

An increase in global temperatures can in turn cause other
[changes](effects_of_global_warming "wikilink"), including [sea level
rise](sea_level_rise "wikilink"), and changes in the amount and pattern
of [precipitation](precipitation_(meteorology) "wikilink"). There may
also be changes in the frequency and intensity of [extreme
weather](extreme_weather "wikilink") events, though it is difficult to
connect specific events to global warming. Other effects may include
changes in agricultural yields, [glacier
retreat](/wiki/Glacier_mass_balance "wikilink"), reduced summer streamflows,
species [extinctions](extinction_risk_from_climate_change "wikilink")
and increases in the ranges of [disease
vectors](/wiki/Vector_(biology) "wikilink").

Remaining scientific [uncertainties](uncertainty "wikilink") include the
exact degree of climate change expected in the future, and how changes
will vary from region to region around the globe. There is ongoing
[political](/wiki/Politics_of_global_warming "wikilink") and [public
debate](global_warming_controversy "wikilink") regarding what, if any,
action should be taken to [reduce or reverse future
warming](/wiki/Mitigation_of_global_warming "wikilink") or to [adapt to its
expected consequences](/wiki/Adaptation_to_global_warming "wikilink"). [Most
national governments](/wiki/List_of_Kyoto_Protocol_signatories "wikilink")
have signed and ratified the [Kyoto Protocol](/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol "wikilink")
aimed at combating greenhouse gas emissions.

Terminology
-----------

The term "global warming" is a specific example of the broader term
[climate change](climate_change "wikilink"), which can also refer to
[global cooling](global_cooling "wikilink"). In common usage the term
refers to recent warming and implies a human influence.[9] The [United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change](/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change "wikilink")
(UNFCCC) uses the term "climate change" for human-caused change, and
"climate variability" for other changes.[10] The term "anthropogenic
climate change" is sometimes used when focusing on human-induced
changes.

Causes

The climate system varies through natural, internal processes and in
response to variations in external forcing factors including [solar
activity](/wiki/Solar_variation "wikilink"), [volcanic](volcano "wikilink")
emissions, variations in the earth's orbit ([orbital
forcing](orbital_forcing "wikilink")) and [greenhouse
gases](greenhouse_gas "wikilink"). The detailed [causes of the recent
warming](attribution_of_recent_climate_change "wikilink") remain an
active field of research, but the [scientific
consensus](scientific_opinion_on_climate_change "wikilink")[11]
identifies increased levels of greenhouse gases due to human activity as
the main influence. This attribution is clearest for the most recent 50
years, for which the most detailed data are available. Contrasting with
the scientific consensus, other hypotheses have been proposed to explain
some of the observed increase in global temperatures, including: the
warming is within the range of natural variation; the warming is a
consequence of coming out of a prior cool period, namely the [Little Ice
Age](/wiki/Little_Ice_Age "wikilink"); or the warming is primarily a result of
variances in [solar radiation](solar_radiation "wikilink").[12]

None of the effects of forcing are instantaneous. Due to the [thermal
inertia](/wiki/Volumetric_heat_capacity "wikilink") of the Earth's oceans and
slow responses of other indirect effects, the Earth's current climate is
not in equilibrium with the forcing imposed. [Climate commitment
studies](/wiki/Climate_commitment_studies "wikilink") indicate that even if
greenhouse gases were stabilized at present day levels, a further
warming of about would still occur.[13]

### Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere

The monthly CO<sub>2</sub> measurements display small seasonal oscillations in an overall yearly uptrend; each year's maximum is reached during the northern hemisphere's late spring, and declines during the northern hemisphere growing season as plants remove some CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere.</figcaption>
</figure>The [greenhouse effect](greenhouse_effect "wikilink") was
discovered by [Joseph Fourier](/wiki/Joseph_Fourier "wikilink") in 1824 and
was first investigated quantitatively by [Svante
Arrhenius](/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius "wikilink") in 1896. It is the process by
which absorption and emission of [infrared](infrared "wikilink")
radiation by [atmospheric gases](/wiki/Atmosphere "wikilink") warms a
[planet](planet "wikilink")'s atmosphere and surface.

Greenhouse gases create a natural greenhouse effect, without which, mean
temperatures on Earth would be an estimated 30 °C (54 °F) lower, so that
Earth would be uninhabitable.[14] Thus scientists do not "believe in" or
"oppose" the greenhouse effect as such; rather, the debate concerns the
net effect of the addition of greenhouse gases, while allowing for
associated [positive](positive_feedback "wikilink") and [negative
feedback](negative_feedback "wikilink") mechanisms.

On Earth, the major natural greenhouse gases are [water
vapor](water_vapor "wikilink"), which causes about 36–70% of the
greenhouse effect ([not including clouds](/wiki/Cloud_forcing "wikilink"));
[carbon dioxide](carbon_dioxide "wikilink") (CO<sub>2</sub>), which
causes 9–26%; [methane](methane "wikilink") (CH<sub>4</sub>), which
causes 4–9%; and [ozone](ozone "wikilink"), which causes 3–7%. The
[atmospheric
concentrations](/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Increase_of_greenhouse_gases "wikilink")
of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> have increased by 31% and 149%
respectively above pre-industrial levels since 1750. These levels are
considerably higher than at any time during the last 650,000 years, the
period for which reliable data has been extracted from [ice
cores](ice_core "wikilink"). From less direct geological evidence it is
believed that CO<sub>2</sub> values this high were last attained 20
million years ago.[15] "About three-quarters of the anthropogenic
\[man-made\] emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere during the
past 20 years are due to [fossil fuel](fossil_fuel "wikilink") burning.
The rest of the anthropogenic emissions are predominantly due to
land-use change, especially
[deforestation](deforestation "wikilink")."[16]

The present atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is about 383
parts per million (ppm) by volume.[17] Future CO<sub>2</sub> levels are
expected to rise due to ongoing burning of fossil fuels and land-use
change. The rate of rise will depend on uncertain economic,
sociological, technological, natural developments, but may be ultimately
limited by the availability of fossil fuels. The IPCC [Special Report on
Emissions Scenarios](/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios "wikilink")
gives a wide range of future CO<sub>2</sub> scenarios, ranging from 541
to 970 ppm by the year 2100.[18] Fossil fuel reserves are sufficient to
reach this level and continue emissions past 2100, if coal, tar sands or
[methane clathrates](methane_clathrate "wikilink") are extensively
used.[19]

Positive feedback effects such as the expected release of CH<sub>4</sub>
from the melting of [permafrost](permafrost "wikilink")
[peat](peat "wikilink") [bogs](bog "wikilink") in
[Siberia](/wiki/Siberia "wikilink") (possibly up to 70,000 million
[tonnes](tonne "wikilink")) may lead to significant additional sources
of greenhouse gas emissions[20] not included in climate models cited by
the IPCC.[21]

### Feedbacks

The effects of forcing agents on the climate are complicated by various
feedback processes.

One of the most pronounced feedback effects relates to the evaporation
of water. CO<sub>2</sub> injected into the atmosphere causes a warming
of the atmosphere and the earth's surface. The warming causes more water
to be evaporated into the atmosphere. Since water vapor itself acts as a
greenhouse gas, this causes still more warming; the warming causes more
water vapor to be evaporated, and so forth until a new dynamic
equilibrium concentration of water vapor is reached at a slight increase
in humidity and with a much larger greenhouse effect than that due to
CO<sub>2</sub> alone.[22] This feedback effect can only be reversed
slowly as CO<sub>2</sub> has a long average [atmospheric
lifetime](/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Removal_from_the_atmosphere_and_global_warming_potential "wikilink").

Feedback effects due to clouds are an area of ongoing research and
debate. Seen from below, clouds absorb infrared radiation and so exert a
warming effect. Seen from above, the same clouds reflect sunlight and so
exert a cooling effect. Increased global water vapor concentration may
or may not cause an increase in global average cloud cover. The net
effect of clouds thus has not been well modeled, however, cloud feedback
is second only to water vapor feedback and is positive in all the models
that contributed to the [IPCC Fourth Assessment
Report](/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report "wikilink").[23]

Another important feedback process is ice-albedo feedback.[24] The
increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere warms the Earth's surface and
leads to melting of ice near the poles. As the ice melts, land or open
water takes its place. Both land and open water are on average less
reflective than ice, and thus absorb more solar radiation. This causes
more warming, which in turn causes more melting, and this cycle
continues.

Positive feedback due to release of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>
from thawing permafrost is an additional mechanism contributing to
warming. Possible positive feedback due to CH<sub>4</sub> release from
melting seabed ices is a further mechanism to be considered.

### Solar variation

<img src="Solar-cycle-data.png" title="fig:Solar variation over the last 30 years." alt="Solar variation over the last 30 years." width="280" />
Variations in [solar output](solar_variation "wikilink"), possibly
amplified by cloud feedbacks, may have contributed to recent
warming.[25] A difference between this mechanism and greenhouse warming
is that an increase in solar activity should produce a warming of the
[stratosphere](stratosphere "wikilink") while greenhouse warming should
produce a cooling of the stratosphere. [Reduction of stratospheric
ozone](/wiki/Ozone_depletion "wikilink") also has a cooling influence but
substantial ozone depletion did not occur until the late 1970's. Cooling
in the lower stratosphere has been observed since at least 1960.[26]

Other phenomena such as solar variation combined with
[volcanoes](volcano "wikilink") have probably had a warming effect from
pre-industrial times to 1950, but a cooling effect since 1950.[27]
However, some research has suggested that the Sun's contribution may
have been underestimated. Two researchers at [Duke
University](/wiki/Duke_University "wikilink") have estimated that the Sun may
have contributed about 40–50% of the global surface temperature warming
over the period 1900–2000, and about 25–35% between 1980 and 2000.[28]
Stott and coauthors suggest that climate models overestimate the
relative effect of greenhouse gases compared to solar forcing; they also
suggest that the cooling effects of volcanic dust and sulfate aerosols
have been underestimated.[29] They conclude that even with an enhanced
climate sensitivity to solar forcing, most of the warming during the
latest decades is attributable to the increases in greenhouse gases.

History
-------

<img src="Ice_Age_Temperature.png" title="fig:Curves of reconstructed temperature at two locations in Antarctica and a global record of variations in glacial ice volume. Today&#39;s date is on the left side of the graph." alt="Curves of reconstructed temperature at two locations in Antarctica and a global record of variations in glacial ice volume. Today&#39;s date is on the left side of the graph." width="280" />

### From the present to the dawn of human settlement

Global temperatures on both land and sea have increased by relative to
the period 1860–1900, according to the [instrumental temperature
record](instrumental_temperature_record "wikilink"). This measured
temperature increase is not significantly affected by the [urban heat
island](urban_heat_island "wikilink"). Since 1979, land temperatures
have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures (0.25 °C per
decade against 0.13 °C per decade).[30] Temperatures in the lower
[troposphere](troposphere "wikilink") have increased between 0.12 and
0.22 °C (0.22 and 0.4 °F) per decade since 1979, according to [satellite
temperature
measurements](satellite_temperature_measurements "wikilink").
[Temperature](/wiki/Temperature_record_of_the_past_1000_years "wikilink") is
believed to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand
years before 1850, with possibly regional fluctuations such as the
[Medieval Warm Period](/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period "wikilink") or the [Little
Ice Age](/wiki/Little_Ice_Age "wikilink").

Based on estimates by [NASA](/wiki/NASA "wikilink")'s [Goddard Institute for
Space Studies](/wiki/Goddard_Institute_for_Space_Studies "wikilink"), 2005 was
the warmest year since reliable, widespread instrumental measurements
became available in the late 1800s, exceeding the previous record set in
1998 by a few hundredths of a degree.[31] Estimates prepared by the
[World Meteorological
Organization](/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization "wikilink") and the
[Climatic Research Unit](/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit "wikilink") concluded
that 2005 was the second warmest year, behind 1998.[32][33]

Anthropogenic emissions of other
[pollutants](pollutant "wikilink")—notably sulfate
[aerosols](/wiki/Particulate "wikilink")—can exert a cooling effect by
increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight. This partially accounts
for the cooling seen in the temperature record in the middle of the
twentieth century,[34] though the cooling may also be due in part to
natural variability.

Paleoclimatologist [William Ruddiman](/wiki/William_Ruddiman "wikilink") has
argued that human influence on the global climate began around 8,000
years ago with the start of forest clearing to provide land for
agriculture and 5,000 years ago with the start of Asian rice
irrigation.[35] Ruddiman's interpretation of the historical record, with
respect to the methane data, has been disputed.[36]

### Pre-human climate variations

<img src="2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png" title="fig:Two millennia of mean surface temperatures according to different reconstructions, each smoothed on a decadal scale. The unsmoothed, annual value for 2004 is also plotted for reference." alt="Two millennia of mean surface temperatures according to different reconstructions, each smoothed on a decadal scale. The unsmoothed, annual value for 2004 is also plotted for reference." width="280" />
Earth has experienced warming and cooling many times in the past. The
recent Antarctic [EPICA](/wiki/EPICA "wikilink") ice core spans 800,000 years,
including eight glacial cycles timed by [orbital
variations](/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles "wikilink") with
[interglacial](interglacial "wikilink") warm periods comparable to
present temperatures.[37]

A rapid buildup of greenhouse gases caused warming in the early
[Jurassic](/wiki/Jurassic "wikilink") period (about 180 million years ago),
with average temperatures rising by 5 °C (9.0 °F). Research by the [Open
University](/wiki/Open_University "wikilink") indicates that the warming
caused the rate of rock weathering to increase by 400%. As such
weathering locks away carbon in [calcite](calcite "wikilink") and
[dolomite](dolomite "wikilink"), CO<sub>2</sub> levels dropped back to
normal over roughly the next 150,000 years.[38][39]

Sudden releases of methane from [clathrate
compounds](clathrate_compound "wikilink") (the [clathrate gun
hypothesis](clathrate_gun_hypothesis "wikilink")) have been hypothesized
as a cause for other warming events in the distant past, including the
[Permian-Triassic extinction
event](/wiki/Permian-Triassic_extinction_event "wikilink") (about 251 million
years ago) and the [Paleocene-Eocene Thermal
Maximum](/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum "wikilink") (about 55 million
years ago).

Climate models
--------------

<img src="Global_Warming_Predictions.png" title="fig:Calculations of global warming prepared in or before 2001 from a range of climate models under the SRES A2 emissions scenario, which assumes no action is taken to reduce emissions." alt="Calculations of global warming prepared in or before 2001 from a range of climate models under the SRES A2 emissions scenario, which assumes no action is taken to reduce emissions." width="280" />

In this figure, the globally averaged warming corresponds to 3.0 °C (5.4 °F)." width="280" />

Scientists have studied global warming with computer models of the
climate. These models are based on physical principles of fluid
dynamics, radiative transfer, and other processes, with some
simplifications being necessary because of limitations in computer
power. These models predict that the net effect of adding greenhouse
gases is to produce a warmer climate. However, even when the same
assumptions of fossil fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emission are
used, the amount of projected warming varies between models and there
still remains a considerable range of [climate
sensitivity](climate_sensitivity "wikilink").

Including uncertainties in the models and in future greenhouse gas
concentrations, the IPCC anticipates a warming of between 1990 and 2100.
Models have also been used to help investigate the [causes of recent
climate change](/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change "wikilink") by
comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from
various natural and human derived causes.

Climate models can produce a good match to observations of global
temperature changes over the last century, but "cannot yet simulate all
aspects of climate."[40] These models do not unambiguously attribute the
warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural
variation or human effects; however, they suggest that the warming since
1975 is dominated by man-made [greenhouse
gas](greenhouse_gas "wikilink") emissions.

Most global climate models, when run to project future climate, are
forced by imposed greenhouse gas scenarios, generally one from the IPCC
[Special Report on Emissions
Scenarios](/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios "wikilink") (SRES).
Less commonly, models may be run by adding a simulation of the [carbon
cycle](carbon_cycle "wikilink"); this generally shows a positive
feedback, though this response is uncertain (under the A2 SRES scenario,
responses vary between an extra 20 and 200 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub>). Some
observational studies also show a positive feedback.[41][42][43]

The representation of clouds is one of the main sources of uncertainty
in present-generation models, though progress is being made on this
problem.[44] There is also an ongoing discussion as to whether climate
models are neglecting important indirect and feedback effects of [solar
variability](solar_variation "wikilink").

Attributed and expected effects
-------------------------------

</figure>Some effects on both the [natural
environment](natural_environment "wikilink") and [human
life](civilization "wikilink") are, at least in part, already being
attributed to global warming. A 2001 report by the IPCC suggests that
[glacier retreat](/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850 "wikilink"), [ice shelf
disruption](/wiki/Ice_shelf#Ice_shelf_disruption "wikilink") such as the
[Larsen Ice Shelf](/wiki/Larsen_Ice_Shelf "wikilink"), [sea level
rise](sea_level_rise "wikilink"), changes in rainfall patterns,
increased intensity and frequency of [extreme weather
events](/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming#More_extreme_weather "wikilink"), are
being attributed in part to global warming.[45] While changes are
expected for overall patterns, intensity, and frequencies, it is
difficult to attribute specific events to global warming. Other expected
effects include water scarcity in some regions and increased
precipitation in others, changes in mountain snowpack, adverse health
effects from warmer temperatures.

Increasing deaths, displacements, and economic losses projected due to
[extreme weather](extreme_weather "wikilink") attributed to global
warming may be exacerbated by growing population densities in affected
areas, although temperate regions are projected to experience some minor
benefits, such as fewer deaths due to cold exposure.[46] A summary of
probable effects and recent understanding can be found in the report
made for the [IPCC Third Assessment
Report](/wiki/IPCC_Third_Assessment_Report "wikilink") by Working Group
II.[47] The newer [IPCC Fourth Assessment
Report](/wiki/IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report "wikilink") summary reports that
there is observational evidence for an increase in intense [tropical
cyclone](tropical_cyclone "wikilink") activity in the North [Atlantic
Ocean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "wikilink") since about 1970, in correlation with
the increase in sea surface temperature, but that the detection of
long-term trends is complicated by the quality of records prior to
routine satellite observations. The summary also states that there is no
clear trend in the annual worldwide number of tropical cyclones.[48]

Additional anticipated effects include sea level rise of between 1990
and 2100,[49] [repercussions to
agriculture](/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture "wikilink"), [possible
slowing of the thermohaline
circulation](/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation "wikilink"),
reductions in the [ozone layer](ozone_layer "wikilink"), increased
intensity and frequency of [hurricanes and extreme weather
events](/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming#More_extreme_weather "wikilink"),
[lowering](/wiki/Ocean_acidification "wikilink") of ocean [pH](pH "wikilink"),
and the spread of diseases such as [malaria](malaria "wikilink") and
[dengue fever](dengue_fever "wikilink"). One study predicts 18% to 35%
of a sample of 1,103 animal and plant species would be
[extinct](extinction_risk_from_climate_change "wikilink") by 2050, based
on future climate projections.[50] Mechanistic studies have documented
extinctions due to recent climate change: McLaughlin *et al.* documented
two populations of [Bay checkerspot
butterfly](/wiki/Bay_checkerspot_butterfly "wikilink") being threatened by
precipitation change.[51] Parmesan states, "Few studies have been
conducted at a scale that encompasses an entire species"[52] and
McLaughlin *et al.* agreed "few mechanistic studies have linked
extinctions to recent climate change."[53]

### Economics

Some economists have tried to estimate the aggregate net economic costs
of damages from climate change across the globe. Such estimates have so
far failed to reach conclusive findings; in a survey of 100 estimates,
the values ran from [US$](/wiki/United_States_dollar "wikilink")-10 per tonne
of carbon (tC) (US$-3 per tonne of carbon dioxide) up to US$350/tC
(US$95 per tonne of carbon dioxide), with a mean of US$43 per tonne of
carbon (US$12 per tonne of carbon dioxide).[54] One widely-publicized
report on potential economic impact is the [Stern
Review](/wiki/Stern_Review "wikilink"); it suggests that extreme weather might
reduce global [gross domestic
product](gross_domestic_product "wikilink") by up to 1%, and that in a
worst case scenario global consumption per head could fall 20%.[55] The
reports methodology, advocacy and conclusions has been criticized by
many economists, primarily around the Review's assumptions of
[discounting](discounting "wikilink") and its choices of scenarios,
while others have supported the general attempt to quantify economic
risk, even if not the specific numbers.

In a summary of economic cost associated with climate change, the
[United Nations Environment
Programme](/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme "wikilink") emphasizes
the risks to [insurers](insurance "wikilink"),
[reinsurers](reinsurance "wikilink"), and [banks](bank "wikilink") of
increasingly traumatic and costly weather events. Other economic sectors
likely to face difficulties related to climate change include
[agriculture](/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture "wikilink") and transport.
Developing countries, rather than the developed world, are at greatest
economic risk.[56]

Mitigation and adaptation
-------------------------

The broad agreement among climate scientists that global temperatures
will continue to increase has led nations, states, corporations and
individuals to implement actions to try to [curtail global
warming](/wiki/Mitigation_of_global_warming "wikilink") or [adjust to
it](/wiki/Adaptation_to_global_warming "wikilink"). Many environmental groups
encourage [action against global
warming](/wiki/Individual_and_political_action_on_climate_change "wikilink"),
often by the consumer, but also by community and regional organizations.
There has been [business action on climate
change](business_action_on_climate_change "wikilink"), including efforts
at increased energy efficiency and (still limited) moves to [alternative
fuels](alternative_fuels "wikilink"). One important innovation has been
the development of greenhouse gas [emissions
trading](emissions_trading "wikilink") through which companies, in
conjunction with government, agree to cap their emissions or to purchase
credits from those below their allowances.

The world's primary international agreement on combating global warming
is the [Kyoto Protocol](/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol "wikilink"), an amendment to the
[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change](/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change "wikilink")
(UNFCCC), negotiated in 1997. The Protocol now covers more than 160
countries globally and over 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions.[57]
The [United States](/wiki/United_States "wikilink"), the world's largest
greenhouse gas emitter; [Australia](/wiki/Australia "wikilink"); and
[Kazakhstan](/wiki/Kazakhstan "wikilink") have refused to ratify the treaty.
[China](/wiki/China "wikilink") and [India](India "wikilink"), two other large
emitters, have ratified the treaty but, as developing countries, are
exempt from its provisions.

Issue debate and political processes
------------------------------------

Increased awareness of the scientific findings surrounding global
warming has resulted in political and economic debate. Poor regions,
particularly [Africa](/wiki/Africa "wikilink"), appear at greatest risk from
the suggested effects of global warming, while their actual emissions
have been negligible compared to the developed world, reports *[The New
York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times "wikilink")*.[58] At the same time,
[developing country](developing_country "wikilink") exemptions from
provisions of the [Kyoto Protocol](/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol "wikilink") have been
criticized by the United States and been used as part of its
justification for continued non-ratification.[59] In the [Western
world](/wiki/Western_world "wikilink"), the idea of human influence on climate
and efforts to combat it has gained wider acceptance in
[Europe](/wiki/Europe "wikilink") than the United States.[60][61]

Fossil fuel companies such as [ExxonMobil](/wiki/ExxonMobil "wikilink") have
spent large sums of money for public relations to downplay the risks of
climate change,[62][63] while environmental groups have launched
campaigns emphasizing its impacts.

This issue has sparked debate in the U.S. about the benefits of limiting
[industrial](industrial_process "wikilink")
[emissions](/wiki/Air_pollution "wikilink") of [greenhouse
gases](greenhouse_gas "wikilink") to reduce impacts to the climate,
versus the effects on economic activity.[64][65] There has also been
discussion in several countries about the cost of adopting alternate,
cleaner [energy sources](alternative_energy "wikilink") in order to
reduce emissions.[66]

Another point of debate is the degree to which [newly-developed
economies](/wiki/Newly_industrialized_country "wikilink"), like
[India](/wiki/India "wikilink") and [China](China "wikilink"), have a right to
[increase](/wiki/Industrialization "wikilink") their industrial emissions,
especially since China is expected to exceed the United States in total
greenhouse gas emissions by 2010,[67] though the U.S. has less than
one-fourth of China's population.[68]

Related climatic issues
-----------------------

A variety of issues are often raised in relation to global warming. One
is [ocean acidification](ocean_acidification "wikilink"), the ongoing
decrease in the [pH](pH "wikilink") of the [Earth](/wiki/Earth "wikilink")'s
oceans. Increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases the amount of
CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the oceans.[69] CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in
the ocean reacts with water to form [carbonic
acid](carbonic_acid "wikilink") resulting in acidification. Ocean
surface pH is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to
8.14 since the beginning of the industrial era,[70] and it is estimated
that it will drop by a further 0.14 to 0.5 units by 2100 as the ocean
absorbs more CO<sub>2</sub>.[71][72] Since organisms and ecosystems are
adapted to a narrow range of pH, this raises
[extinction](extinction "wikilink") concerns, directly driven by
increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, that could disrupt food webs and
impact human societies that depend on marine ecosystem services.[73]

Another related issue that may have partially mitigated global warming
in the late twentieth century is [global
dimming](global_dimming "wikilink"), the gradual reduction in the amount
of global direct [irradiance](irradiance "wikilink") at the Earth's
surface. From 1960 to 1990 human-caused aerosols likely precipitated
this effect. Scientists have stated with 66–90% confidence that the
effects of human-caused aerosols, along with volcanic activity, have
offset some of global warming, and that greenhouse gases would have
resulted in more warming than observed if not for these dimming
agents.[74]

[Ozone depletion](/wiki/Ozone_depletion "wikilink"), the steady decline in the
total amount of [ozone](ozone "wikilink") in Earth's
[stratosphere](stratosphere "wikilink"), is frequently cited in relation
to global warming. Although there are [areas of
linkage](/wiki/Ozone_depletion#Ozone_depletion_and_global_warming "wikilink"),
the relationship between the two is not strong.
