An **electric vehicle**, or EV, is a [vehicle](vehicle "wikilink") with
one or more [electric motors](electric_motor "wikilink") for propulsion.
The motion may be provided either by [wheels](wheels "wikilink") or
[propellers](propellers "wikilink") driven by rotary motors, or in the
case of tracked vehicles, by [linear motors](linear_motor "wikilink").

The [energy](energy "wikilink") used to propel the vehicle may be
obtained from several sources:

-   from [chemical energy](chemical_energy "wikilink") stored on the
    vehicle in on-board batteries: [Battery electric
    vehicle](/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle "wikilink") (BEV)
-   from both an on-board rechargeable energy storage system
    ([RESS](rechargeable_energy_storage_system "wikilink")) and a fueled
    propulsion power source: [hybrid
    vehicle](hybrid_vehicle "wikilink"), including [plug-in
    hybrid](plug-in_hybrid "wikilink")
-   generated on-board using a combustion engine, as in a
    [diesel-electric](diesel-electric "wikilink") locomotive
-   generated on-board using a [fuel cell](fuel_cell "wikilink"): [fuel
    cell vehicle](fuel_cell_vehicle "wikilink")
-   generated on-board using [nuclear
    energy](nuclear_energy "wikilink"), on nuclear
    [submarines](submarine "wikilink") and [aircraft
    carriers](aircraft_carrier "wikilink")
-   from more esoteric sources such as [flywheels](/wiki/Gyrobus "wikilink"),
    [wind](wind_energy "wikilink") and [solar](solar_car "wikilink")
-   from a direct connection to land-based generation plants, as is
    common in [electric trains](electric_train "wikilink") and [trolley
    buses](trolleybus "wikilink") (See also : [third
    rail](third_rail "wikilink") and [Conduit current
    collection](/wiki/Conduit_current_collection "wikilink"))
-   from both an on-board rechargeable energy storage system and a
    direct continuous connection to land-based generation plants for
    purposes of on-highway recharging with unrestricted highway range.

### Advantages of electric vehicles

Electric motors are used to drive vehicles because they can be finely
controlled, they deliver power efficiently and they are mechanically
very simple. Electric motors often achieve 90% conversion efficiency
over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely
controlled. Electric motors can provide high torque while an EV is
stopped, unlike [internal combustion
engines](internal_combustion_engine "wikilink"), and do not need gears
to match power curves. This removes the need for
[gearboxes](/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics) "wikilink") and [torque
converters](torque_converter "wikilink"). Electric motors also have the
ability to convert movement energy back into electricity, through
[regenerative braking](regenerative_braking "wikilink"). This can be
used to reduce the wear on brake systems and reduce the total energy
requirement of a trip.

Another advantage is that electric vehicles lack the vibration and noise
pollution of a vehicle powered by an [internal combustion
engine](internal_combustion_engine "wikilink").
[Trolleybuses](/wiki/Trolleybus "wikilink") are especially capable of this
advantage, due to the fact that trolleybuses also lack the noise of
steel wheels on rails, unlike [Trams](/wiki/Tram "wikilink").

Why electricity?:

-   First, electricity offers outstanding benefits, beginning with the
    opportunity to diversify fuel sources “upstream” of the vehicle. In
    other words, the electricity that is used to drive the vehicle can
    be made from the best local clean fuel sources – preferly [renewable
    energy](renewable_energy "wikilink") sources. So, before you even
    start your vehicle, you’re working toward energy diversity.
-   Second, electrically driven vehicles… are zero-emission vehicles.
    And when the electricity, itself, is made from a renewable source,
    the entire energy pathway is emissions free.
-   Third, electrically driven vehicles offer great performance… with
    extraordinary acceleration, instant torque, improved driving
    dynamics, and so on.

Large-scale electric transport
------------------------------

Most large electric transport systems are powered by stationary sources
of electricity that are directly connected to the vehicles through
wires. Due to the extra infrastructure and difficulty in handling
arbitrary travel, most directly connected vehicles are owned publicly or
by large companies. These forms of transportation are covered in more
detail in [maglev trains](/wiki/Magnetic_levitation_train "wikilink"),
[metros](metro "wikilink"), [trams](tram "wikilink"),
[trains](train "wikilink") and [trolleybuses](trolleybus "wikilink"). A
hypothetical electric vehicle design is the [personal rapid
transit](personal_rapid_transit "wikilink"), a cross between cars and
trains optimised for independent travel.

In most systems the motion is provided by a rotary electric motor.
However, some trains unroll their motors to drive directly against a
special matched track. These are known as [linear
motors](linear_motor "wikilink") and are most commonly used in maglev
trains which float above the rails through magnetic force. This allows
for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear
and tear of the train or track. The levitation and the forward motion
are independent effects; the forward motive forces still require
external power, but [Inductrack](/wiki/Inductrack "wikilink") achieves
levitation at low speeds without any.

Chemical-electric power
-----------------------

<figure>

</figure>Chemical energy is a common independent energy source. Chemical
energy is converted to electrical energy, which is then regulated and
fed to the drive motors. Chemical energy is usually in the form of
[diesel](diesel "wikilink") or [petrol](petrol "wikilink")
([gasoline](gasoline "wikilink")). The liquid fuels are usually
converted into electricity by an [electrical
generator](electrical_generator "wikilink") powered by an internal
combustion engine or other [heat engine](heat_engine "wikilink"). This
approach is known as [diesel-electric](diesel-electric "wikilink") or
gas-[hybrid](hybrid_vehicle "wikilink") locomotion.

Another common form of chemical to electrical conversion is by
electro-chemical devices. These include [fuel
cells](fuel_cell "wikilink") and
[batteries](battery_(electricity) "wikilink"). By avoiding an
intermediate mechanical step, the conversion efficiency is dramatically
improved over the chemical-thermal-mechanical-electrical-mechanical
process already discussed. This is due to the higher carnot efficiency
through directly oxidizing the fuel and by avoiding several unnecessary
energy conversions. Furthermore, electro-chemical batteries conversions
are easy to reverse, allowing electrical energy to be stored in chemical
form.

Despite the higher efficiency, electro-chemical vehicles have been beset
by a technical issue which has prevented them from replacing the more
cumbersome heat engines: energy storage. Fuel cells are fragile,
sensitive to contamination, and require external reactants such as
[hydrogen](hydrogen "wikilink"). Batteries currently used are either not
mass-produced, leading to high per-unit prices, or end up being a
significant (25%-50%) portion of the final vehicle mass, in the case of
conventional lead-acid technology. Both have lower
[energy](/wiki/Energies_per_unit_mass "wikilink") and [power
density](/wiki/Specific_power "wikilink") than petroleum fuels. However,
recent advances in battery efficiency, capacity, materials, safety,
toxicity and durability are likely to allow their superior
characteristics to be widely applied in car-sized EVs,

For especially large electric vehicles, such as
[submarines](submarine "wikilink") and [aircraft
carriers](aircraft_carrier "wikilink"), the chemical energy of the
diesel-electric can be replaced by a [nuclear
reactor](nuclear_reactor "wikilink"). The nuclear reactor usually
provides heat, which drives a [steam turbine](steam_turbine "wikilink"),
which drives a generator, which is then fed to the propulsion.

Electric motor
--------------

The power of a vehicle electric motor, as in other vehicles, is measured
in [kw](kw "wikilink").

History
-------

<img src="Ed_d22m.jpg" title="fig:Edison and an electric car, 1913 (courtesy of the National Museum of American History)" alt="Edison and an electric car, 1913 (courtesy of the National Museum of American History)" width="250" />
Electric motive power started with a small railway operated by a
miniature electric motor, built by [Thomas
Davenport](/wiki/Thomas_Davenport "wikilink") in [1835](1835 "wikilink"). In
[1838](1838 "wikilink"), a Scotsman named [Robert
Davidson](/wiki/Robert_Davidson "wikilink") built an electric locomotive that
attained a speed of four miles an hour. In [England](/wiki/England "wikilink")
a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of
electric current, and similar American patents were issued to [Lilley
and Colten](/wiki/Lilley_and_Colten "wikilink") in [1847](1847 "wikilink").
[1]

Between 1832 and 1839 (the exact year is uncertain), [Robert
Anderson](/wiki/Robert_Anderson_(businessman) "wikilink") of
[Scotland](/wiki/Scotland "wikilink") invented the first crude electric
carriage, powered by non-rechargeable [Primary
cells](/wiki/Primary_cell "wikilink"). [2]

By the 20th century, electric cars and rail transport were commonplace,
with commercial electric automobiles having the majority of the market.
Electrified trains were used for [coal](coal "wikilink") transport as
the motors did not use precious [oxygen](oxygen "wikilink") in the
mines. [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland "wikilink")'s lack of natural fossil
resources forced the rapid electrification of [their rail
network](/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Switzerland "wikilink"). One of the earliest
[rechargeable batteries](rechargeable_batteries "wikilink") - the
[Nickel-iron battery](/wiki/Nickel-iron_battery "wikilink") - was favored by
[Edison](/wiki/Edison "wikilink") for use in [electric
cars](electric_cars "wikilink").

Electric vehicles were among the earliest automobiles, and before the
preeminence of light, powerful [internal combustion
engines](internal_combustion_engines "wikilink"), electric automobiles
held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early
[1900s](1900s "wikilink"). They were produced by [Anthony
Electric](/wiki/Anthony_Electric "wikilink"), [Baker
Electric](/wiki/Baker_Electric "wikilink"), [Detroit
Electric](/wiki/Detroit_Electric "wikilink"), and others and at one point in
history out-sold gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the early 20th century, [National City
Lines](/wiki/National_City_Lines "wikilink"), which was a partnership of
[General Motors](/wiki/General_Motors "wikilink"),
[Firestone](/wiki/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company "wikilink"), and [Standard
Oil of California](/wiki/Standard_Oil_of_California "wikilink") purchased many
electric [tram](tram "wikilink") networks across the country to
dismantle them and replace them with GM buses. The partnership was
convicted for this
[conspiracy](/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy "wikilink"), but the
ruling was overturned in a higher court. Electric tram line technologies
could be used to recharge [BEVs](/wiki/BEV "wikilink") and
[PHEVs](/wiki/PHEV "wikilink") on the highway while the user drives, providing
virtually unrestricted driving range. The technology is old and well
established (see : [Conduit current
collection](/wiki/Conduit_current_collection "wikilink"), [Nickel-iron
battery](/wiki/Nickel-iron_battery "wikilink")). The infrastructure has not
been built.

</figure>From 1996 to 1998 during emissions reductions regulations GM
produced 1117 of their [EV1](/wiki/General_Motors_EV1 "wikilink") models, 800
of which were made available through 3-year leases. In
[2003](2003 "wikilink"), upon the expiration of
[EV1](/wiki/General_Motors_EV1 "wikilink") leases, GM crushed them. The reason
for the crushing is not clear, but has variously been attributed to (1)
the auto industry's successful challenge to California law requiring
zero emission vehicles or (2) a federal regulation requiring GM to
produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousands EV1s or (3) a
conspiracy to remove the dream of electric vehicles from the public
consciousness. A movie made on the subject in 2005-2006 was titled [Who
Killed the Electric Car?](/wiki/Who_killed_the_electric_car "wikilink") and
released theatrically by [Sony Pictures
Classics](/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Classics "wikilink") in 2006. The film explores
the roles of [automobile
manufacturers](automobile_manufacturer "wikilink"), [oil
industry](oil_industry "wikilink"), the [US
government](/wiki/US_government "wikilink"),
[batteries](batteries "wikilink"), [hydrogen
vehicles](/wiki/Hydrogen_(car) "wikilink"), and
[consumers](consumer "wikilink"), and each of their roles in limiting
the deployment and adoption of this technology.

</div>

Several start-up companies, like [Tesla Motors](/wiki/Tesla_Motors "wikilink")
and [Phoenix Motorcars](/wiki/Phoenix_Motorcars "wikilink"), will have
powerful battery-electric vehicles available to the public in 2008.
Battery and energy storage technology is advancing rapidly. Electric car
are perfectly useful as second household vehicle for usual short and
medium distance trips of 100 to 250 miles per charge. The range issue
will be improved by technologies such as [Plug-in
hybrid](/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid "wikilink") electric vehicles which are capable
of using traditional fuels for unlimited range.

### Improved long term energy storage and nano batteries

There have been several developments which could bring back electric
vehicles outside of their current fields of application, as scooters,
golf cars, neighborhood vehicles, in industrial operational yards and
indoor operation. First, advances in [lithium-based battery
technology](/wiki/Lithium_ion_battery "wikilink"), in large part driven by the
consumer electronics industry, allow full-sized, highway-capable
electric vehicles to be propelled as far on a single charge as
conventional cars go on a single tank of gasoline. Lithium batteries
have been made safe, can be recharged in minutes instead of hours, and
now last longer than the typical vehicle. The production cost of these
lighter, higher-capacity lithium batteries is gradually decreasing as
the technology matures and production volumes increase.

### Introduction of Battery Management and Intermediate Storage

Another improvement was to decouple the electric motor from the battery
through electronic control while employing
[ultra-capacitors](ultra-capacitor "wikilink") to buffer large but short
power demands and [regenerative
braking](regenerative_braking "wikilink") energy. The development of new
cell types combined with intelligent cell management improved both weak
points mentioned above. The cell management involves not only monitoring
the health of the cells but also a redundant cell configuration (one
more cell than needed). With sophisticated switched wiring it is
possible to condition one cell while the rest are on duty.
